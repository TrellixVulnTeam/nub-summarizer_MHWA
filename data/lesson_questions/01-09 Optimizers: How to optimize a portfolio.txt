Your final project in this mini course is to create a portfolio optimizer. That might sound like a tough problem, but you've already got the tools to do it. In this short lesson, we're going to lay the groundwork to help you know what portfolio optimization is and how to build one. First, what is portfolio optimization? Given a set of assets and a time period, find an allocation of funds to assets that maximizes performance. What is performance? We could choose from a number of metrics, including cumulative return, volatility or risk, and risk adjusted return, which is Sharpe ratio [LAUGH]. You can use any criteria you like, but for this assignment, we're going to focus on Sharpe ratio. Now, let me show you how to use a minimizer to optimize a portfolio. As an example consider this portfolio where we have Google, Apple, Gold, and Exxon from the beginning of 2010 to the end of 2010. This is what the performance of that portfolio would look like in the blue line, if we had an equal allocation to each asset. The optimizers we use in this class have the ability for you to express that and that guarantees that at the end when it finds out the values for X, you end up with a total of 100% allocated to the various assets. Now we're going to show you how to do these two things in the assignment text itself, because the syntax is a little bit tricky and we want to convey to you exactly how to do that. So we look forward to seeing you solve this problem and good luck on your final project.
