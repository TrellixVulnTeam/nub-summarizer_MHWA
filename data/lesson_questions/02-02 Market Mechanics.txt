We're going to dive now into the details of what happens when you create an order, and how it gets to the market and back. And how things can go wrong, and how they can potentially go right. The first stop there is to think about what is actually in an order. What are the components of an order that can go to a stock exchange? Here is all the information that must go into a well-formed order. First of all, I need to know are you looking to buy or sell shares of a stock? Next is the symbol. This is an identifier for the stock or perhaps ETF that you want to buy or sell, for instance IBM or SPLV. Next you need to tell your broker how many shares you want to buy or sell. Stocks and ETFs and other assets are sold in units of shares, not by amount of money. So you don't tell your broker I want $100,000 worth of Apple, you tell your broker I want a thousand shares of Apple. Next, you need to tell your broker whether this is a limit order or a market order. Let's start with market first, market means you're willing to accept a good price but essentially whatever price the market is currently bearing. But probably the most important and most impactful kind of order the brokers implement for you is something called selling short. What selling short allows you to do is take a negative position on a stock, in other words, you sell a stock short if you believe its price is going to go down. Keep in mind here we're selling stock we don't even own. So how is that possible? Well, again, it's possible because the broker facilitates it for you, and I'll explain how in just a minute. So if you bet wrong when you short a stock and the price goes up, you lose money, and it can be significant. So to recap, we've gone through many of the different aspects of the mechanics of the market. We've shown you how hedge funds exploit the market. We've shown you different order types. And we've shown you especially the details of short selling.
