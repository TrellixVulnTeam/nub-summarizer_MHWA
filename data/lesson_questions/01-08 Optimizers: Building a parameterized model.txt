In this lesson we're going to look at optimizers. What is an optimizer? An optimizer is an algorithm that can do the following things. Optimizers can be used to find minimum values for functions. So say you have a function like f(x)=x2+x3+5 or something like that, an optimizer can find. For what value of x is this overall function minimized? Another thing that optimizers can do is find the parameters for parameterized models from data. So we might have some data from some experiment, and we can use optimizers to find a polynomial fit to that data. And that is actually one thing we are going to learn in this lesson. Finally, we can use an optimizer to refine allocations to stocks in portfolios. What does that mean? Well, that means for instance, you can decide what percentage of funds should be allocated to each stock using an optimizer.In other words, how do we measure error and what are we trying to minimize? And the degree of the polynomial. We created an initial guess. In other words, what do we think the values of the coefficients are? And what we're doing here is we're just setting them all to be ones. We plot that, and then we call our minimizer, just like before. We have to tell it, what's the error function we're trying to minimize? What's our initial guess? We have to pass along the data, which then gets passed to the error function, and again, this method, SLS Q P and finally, you can't see it it is off to the side there, but same options essentially they are verbose options. And that's it that's how we use Python to create a model based on data. Let's review what we learned. I showed you how to use a minimizer to find x such that f of x is minimized. I showed you how to minimize in multiple dimensions. And how to use a minimizer to build a parametrized model. Where can you go from here? There are a number of ways you can carry this forward. You can use functions besides polynomials, you can model stock prices, or you can optimize a portfolio.
