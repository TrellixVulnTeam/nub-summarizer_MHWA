8127,"Depression: Nurse Victorino Chua wrote a long note in which he said he had 'a devil in me', Manchester Crown Court has heard . A nurse accused of murdering three patients in a hospital poisoning spree warned there was ‘a devil’ in him, a jury heard yesterday. Victorino Chua penned what he called a ‘bitter nurse confession’ in which he spelled out ‘how an angel can turn to an evil person’. In 13 pages of rambling, broken handwritten English, the Filipino nurse said he might ‘explode’ at any time, adding: ‘If I will be pushed, they gonna be sorry.’ Chua is accused of killing three patients by contaminating their saline drips with insulin and deliberately poisoning 18 others at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport between 2011 and 2012. His lawyers say the document – found in his home following his arrest – is not a criminal confession but an ‘outlet for his anger and frustration’ written at the suggestion of a counsellor 12 months before the first alleged poisoning. But questioned by detectives after his arrest for changing patients’ prescriptions on the wards, the 49-year-old said: ‘Sometimes I snap’. Dependant on painkillers, sleeping tablets and antidepressants, Chua also wrote that he sometimes felt like killing himself, but feared he would ‘go straight to hell no questions asked’. As the prosecution in his trial at Manchester Crown Court drew to a close yesterday after nearly three months, the jury were read the entire document which was found in a kitchen drawer of his home in Stockport after he was arrested in January 2012. Chua sat impassively in the dock as jurors were told how over more than a dozen pages of sometimes hard-to-follow broken English written in scrawling capital letters, he recounts the story of his life, beginning: ‘My name is Victorino Domingo Chua.’ Document: Extracts from the 13-page note show that Chua wrote about 'a devil in me', going 'straight to hell' and being 'an evil person' making a 'bitter nurse confession' In the document, the father of two said he was writing ‘in case something happen to me (so) my family can continue my case or can tell somebody to look at it and work out how and (sic) angel turn to an evil person’. He added: ‘The bitter nurse confession. Got lots to tell but I just take it to my grave. My family will make history here in England.’ The jury has been told the ‘case’ refers to a complaint he had lodged against his local GP surgery after it mistakenly posted his confidential medical records to a different address. In a later addition to the document dated December 2010, Chua described how he could control the number of painkillers he took for back and knee pain when he was at home – but at work he ‘can’t help it to take more than the limit’. He added: ‘I’m just telling them I’m fine and alright just to shut there (sic) mouth. ‘Still inside of me I can feel the anger that any time it will explode ... just still hanging on ... can still control it but if I will be pushed they gonna be sorry.’ Earlier he wrote how he was avoiding going drinking with friends, adding: ‘They thought I’m a nice person but there (is) a devil in me.’ Deaths on the ward: (Left to right) Patients Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71 and Derek Weaver, 83 . Allegations: Chua is accused of killing three patients at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, pictured . The jury was also read sections of Chua’s police interviews during which he was asked about working on two wards where he is alleged to have murdered patients Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and 83-year-old Derek Weaver. He replies: ‘Sometimes I snap.’ Asked what he meant, Chua said he would tell colleagues to ‘leave me alone’ because if they distracted his work on the busy admissions unit he would be ‘back to square one again’. Chua said he normally did a 44-hour week with up to 12 hours’ overtime, doing the overnight shift so he could help his wife with their children during the day. In the document, Chua described his upbringing in the Philippines and how his life changed when his wealthy businessman father split from his mother. Once ‘the envy’ of relatives and neighbours, he and his siblings struggled to get by after the marriage breakdown. He described befriending wealthy students by buying them drugs or dealing for them, while earning extra money by doing odd jobs like washing cars. He lived with his grandmother, who he said pushed him into nursing even though ‘I don’t like it’. He had a difficult relationship with his father, he said, and when he saw him suffer a fatal heart attack in 1986 ‘I didn’t feel anything’. Chua described himself at that time as ‘a naughty boy, doing bad things’, taking medical gear from the Manila hospital where he worked and selling them to people who couldn’t afford treatment. ‘I’m evil, at the same time angel,’ he wrote. Eventually he lost his job and supported his new wife and their young daughter by buying and selling cars before applying to work in Britain in 2002. He started working at care homes in Warrington and Stockport, suffering a prolapsed disc hoisting a patient in 2003 which left him dependant on painkillers, a problem made worse when he later injured his knee falling in snow. After he started work at Stepping Hill Hospital in 2009 – which he said he ‘loved’ – Chua described his state of mind as ‘can’t sleep, paranoid and mental’ and said he would stay in his room all day. He hated noise and shopping trips, adding: ‘I see small things as a big problem.’ He wrote that he went to visit relatives in Japan and considered not returning, but decided to stay in England. Chua added that he sometimes wanted to ‘end my life’ but needed to be with his family, adding that ‘if I go, I go straight to hell no question ask(ed)’. Chua denies murder as well as 24 counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, eight of attempting to administer poison, one of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and one of administering poison. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Victorino Chua, 49, wrote 13-page document  describing his battle with depression and physical injury .

7455,"In February, when Lady Gaga went on stage at the Oscars, millions of viewers in more than 200 countries saw her perform a tribute to The Sound of Music to mark its 50th anniversary. In Los Angeles there was a standing ovation when the original star, Julie Andrews, came on stage. However, one country was left baffled: Austria, where the movie was set and filmed. ‘We didn’t really know what was going on,’ said one Austrian I know. Each year, 300,000 people come to Salzburg to soak up the magic and visit the locations of the film – it’s the reason three-quarters of all tourists head to the city. The beautiful flower beds of at Mirabell Gardens in Salzburg that Sound of Music fans will recognise . Julie Andrews from the beloved film The Sound of Music, fans of which continue to flock to Salzburg . The first tours started shortly after the film opened, but now buses emblazoned with The Sound of Music circle the city, day in, day out. And the Austrians still don’t get it. You’ll be looking a long time in the Salzburg tourist shops before you find a Julie Andrews postcard for sale, let alone lederhosen fashioned from curtain fabric. There are some real advantages in this if you’re a fan of The Sound of Music. And I am. It means there’s nothing to stop me from splashing about in fountains while humming that I have confidence or juggling fruit in the markets (perhaps not a good idea). The Old Town, where much of the movie was shot, is too narrow for tour buses, and that fact – combined with the lack of tourist tat – means there’s nothing to break the spell as you slide into The Sound of Music mindset. Also happily for fans of the film, Salzburg is a pretty conservative sort of place, and doesn’t rush about embracing change. Half a century after shooting the movie, Julie Andrews could return to the city and wander round without too many shocks to the system (providing she overlooked the McDonald’s on Getreidegasse, sitting uncomfortably amid shops selling Austrian national dress). For me, Salzburg is the most hummable city ever – although the tunes you find yourself humming are probably not those that would be chosen by the city fathers. Lady Gaga paid tribute to the film, in the presence of its original star, for its 50 anniversary at the Oscars . Built into the mountains, in medieval times the church harnessed much of the local wealth that came from salt mining – in fact, it still owns a lot of the surrounding land, and built the magnificent monasteries and convents that dominate the city. The real Maria von Trapp – played by Andrews in the film – actually did become a novice at Nonnberg, which was founded in the 8th Century. Head past here around 7pm and you’re still likely to hear the real-life nuns singing Gregorian chants. Bells peel at every opportunity and the mountains – well, it’s safe to say they haven’t changed much. On my first trip, more than 20 years ago, I stayed at an independent hostel, the Yoho (www.yoho.at) in Paracelsusstrasse, which I’m pleased to say is still going strong and still showing The Sound Of Music for free each night. Then it was a solitary outpost of Rodgers and Hammerstein-based enthusiasm, but now there are encouraging signs that the rest of Austria may just be starting to catch on. Sound of Music tourism began almost immediately after the film's release and is still going strong . My hotel for this trip, the rather more luxurious Castellani Parkhotel, shows the film on a continual loop on one of its TV channels. I could wake up to Climb Ev’ry Mountain and nod off to Sixteen Going On Seventeen. And I did. It was an ideal base for a Sound of Music weekend. The hotel even has its own wedding chapel – a gorgeous baroque concoction created during its days as an aristocratic mansion. It has to be said that breakfast doesn’t really feature in the film, which is the perfect excuse to start the day with apple strudel. And the best place to do so? Cafe Tomaselli, Salzburg’s oldest, dating from the 18th Century, right in the centre of the city in Alter Markt. The coffee is strong, served in multiple ways, while its strudel has spiced apple and crisp pastry, and is drenched in enough sugar to start an avalanche. Then it’s time to tick off a few of the key sights. First up, the Residenzplatz, just outside the cafe. In the movie it’s draped with Nazi flags. Cafe Tomaselli , Salzburg’s oldest, dates back to the 18th Century and is in the centre of the city in Alter Markt . Rumour has it that as the Second World War had ended just 20 years earlier, the city authorities weren’t keen on the flags, but the producers won them round by saying that the alternative was to use original footage of the German annexation of Austria in the film. Then there’s St Peter’s Cemetery – a series of catacombs that the movie’s set designers used as inspiration for the flight scenes – and the Felsenreitschule, the open-air theatre that was used for the concert scenes. Now it shows operas and concerts. As for the Salzach, the river that the city straddles, you cross it via the Mozart bridge, used by Maria and the children as they sang Do-Re-Mi. The Mirabell Gardens on the other side of the river allow an even fuller expression of appreciation for the film. Pat the head of the stone dwarf; jump up and down the steps; run about a lot! Many people do it and – even more hearteningly – post the results on YouTube. And all the time, Austrians are just enjoying walking in the gardens, completely oblivious, next to a palace built by an archbishop for his 15 children (particularly noteworthy in a Catholic country). Residenzplatz, just outside Cafe Tomaselli, was draped in Nazi flags in the 50-year-old film . But to really immerse yourself in the full experience, and to see the more outlying locations, you have to take a tour. I’ve taken a few in my time – I tend to feel them calling me each time I head to Salzburg, just as Maria felt the mountains calling her. Over the years I’ve been accompanied on them by groups ranging from unthrilled Austrians to up-for-it Australians in dirndls who had us singing the different parts of The Lonely Goatherd as we headed into the mountains. This time, however, I was accompanied by Gerry, an Austrian who’d actually seen the film, as well as Brits (loads), Americans, and a family from Malaysia. We headed to Hellbrunn, where the gazebo from Sixteen Going On Seventeen is now housed (and now locked after too many fans tried to leap from bench to bench and injured themselves). We also passed the house that served as the main location for the von Trapp family home. It’s now part of the Mozarteum Music Academy, and the easiest way to stay there is to become a top-flight musician. Sarah Turner found herself singing along to The Lonely Goatherd with up-for-it Australians in dirndls . We then started climbing our way into the mountains that feature in the opening shots – now augmented with nice chalets, as this area is a popular escape for posh Austrians and Germans – and gazed down at the town of Fuschl and its lake, one of Austria’s most famous views. British Airways offers return flights from Gatwick to Salzburg from £102. Rooms at the Castellani Parkhotel Salzburg start at £95. Tours with Panorama start at £29 per person. Finally, we arrived at Mondsee. This lakeside town provided the church used for the wedding. About 70 per cent of the people on the trip (there is an over-representation of women) took the chance to walk down the aisle. Needless to say, I was among them. I emerged, blinking, into the sunlight to enjoy cake shops and, amazingly, a shop selling film memorabilia. I felt thrilled. It seemed the whole world was now united in its love for this movie – even Austrians themselves. What’s more, the state theatre in Salzburg – the Landestheater – now even has a production of The Sound Of Music. It’s only taken 50 years. There’s just one thing to remember. Edelweiss is not the Austrian national anthem, whatever Ronald Reagan thought. He once arranged to have it played when the Austrian ambassador arrived at the White House.","Each year 300,000 people visit Salzburg to visit magical filming locations .

But that hasn't stopped this modest timber shed being put up for sale for £230,000 – making it one of Britain's most expensive beach huts. Measuring just 15ft by 10ft, the remote beach hut on Mudeford Spit in Christchurch, Dorset, is the same price as a five-bedroom house in Herefordshire and more than a detached four-bedroom house in Kingswood, Hull. Owners will also have to shell out between £2,500 and £4,000 a year in ground rent to Christchurch Borough Council for use of the hut which can sleep up to five people.

The hut can sleep ten (at a squash) with a first floor mezzanine, two sofa beds and a pull-out double bed, and it has a small kitchen area and fridge freezer for the £270,000 price-tag . The beach hut's remote location means it can only be reach by boat or a novelty 'Noddy' train, followed by a half-mile hike across the dunes. It boasts a desirable position on the end of a row near the river entrance, meaning there is nothing but open space next to it. The current owner, who doesn't want to be named, is selling the hut privately. Steve Barratt, chairman of the Mudeford Beach Hut Association, said: 'Most huts these days have solar panels to meet lighting and entertainment needs and most have fridges, making the overall living experience better. They are a home from home. 'The main benefit of being in a hut is that even if the weather is changeable and you would not consider visiting the beach from home, being there means that as soon as the rain stops you can open the doors to enjoy the natural beauty of the sandbank. 'In the summer thousands of visitors come to the beaches for the day and as a hut owner you can have the benefit of a busy seaside scene that will evaporate when the visitors leave and by 7pm the beach becomes a quiet, social retreat you can share with your beach friends.' Hut 433 on Mudeford Spit went on sale for £270,000 in July 2014 - making it the most expensive beach hut in Britain. Denisons Estate Agents said the market for beach huts and Mudeford has snowballed over the last few years and many go for more than £200,000. Andy Denison said: 'They do seem to be fetching around the £200,000-mark now and there are rumours of them going higher than that. 'It seems like a lot of money but people are willing to pay that, even though they've still got to rent the land from the council as well.

10189,"During its 25 years in space, Hubble has provided the world with unprecedented views of the universe. But to help it find alien life, Nasa needs an even more powerful tool to peer back into the depths of our cosmos. The agency hopes to do this with the James Webb Space Telescope, which will be 100 times more potent than Hubble, and will be able to see back to 200 million years after the Big Bang. The James Webb Space Telescope will be 100 times more potent than Hubble, and will be able to see back to 200 million years after the Big Bang. Pictured are Nasa scientists completing a series of cryogenic tests on six James Webb Space Telescope beryllium mirror segments . Nasa describes the telescope as a 'powerful time machine with infrared vision that will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe.' The project has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers for its ballooning costs - now at about $8.8 billion, far higher than the initial estimate of $3.5 bn (£2.33 bn). But Nasa has promised to keep the next-generation telescope on track for its October 2018 launch. 'What the Webb will really be doing is looking at the first galaxies of the universe,' Webb telescope observatory project scientist Mark Clampin. 'We will also be able, with these capabilities, to look in very dark parts of the universe where stars are being born.' Nasa describes the telescope as a 'powerful time machine with infrared vision that will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe' The James Webb Space Telescope will be 100 times more potent than Hubble, and will be able to see back to 200 million years after the Big Bang. Pictured is an artist's impression . The space telescope will weigh 6.4 tons. JWST's main mirror will be 21ft (6.5 metres) in diameter, three times as large as Hubble's . Inside a massive room that is partially closed off from view, in clean room where no dust can harm the telescope, a team of engineers dressed in white, resembling surgeons, work on building the JWST. The space telescope will weigh 6.4 tons. JWST's main mirror will be 21ft (6.5 metres) in diameter, three times as large as Hubble's. There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy – and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington earlier this month, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, said. 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Jeffery Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' said Stofan. 'We are talking about little microbes.' The announcement has been prompted by the recent discovery of water by Nasa in surprising places. Jim Green, director of planetary science at Nasa, noted that a recent study of the Martian atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep. A joint project of Nasa, the European and canadian space agencies, JWST will carry four instruments, including cameras and spectrometers that can capture extremely faint signals. Infra-red capability will help it observe distant celestial bodies, and its camera shutter will be able to remain open for long periods, explained Matt Greenhouse, JWST project scientist for the science instrument payload. 'The Webb will have 70 times the light-gathering capacity of Hubble. So the combination of the large size and the infra-red capabilities will allow us to observe this epic of the universe past,' he said in an interview. Even more, the telescope should further the search for life elsewhere in the universe by opening a new window on planets outside the solar system  that might have water. Already, Nasa's Kepler Space telescope, launched in 2009, has helped astronomers identify thousands of exoplanets. JWST is expected to propel that research even further. 'Webb is quite big enough to have a high probability of finding bio signatures in the atmosphere of exoplanets, evidence of life,' Greenhouse said. 'We have sensors on board, equipment on board that will enable us to study the atmosphere of exoplanets spectroscopically. So we will be able to understand the composition of those atmospheres,' he added. 'We can make big progress in the search for life.' Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, which circles the Earth, the JWST will go even further, to a place called L2, for LaGrange Point, 930,000 miles (1.5 million km) away in space. That distance will keep the telescope cold, prevent it from being blinded by its own infra-red light and shelter it from radiation. 'It will follow the Earth around the sun over the course of the year. So it's in a sun center orbit instead of an Earth center orbit,' said Greenhouse. The heavy telescope is scheduled to launch atop an Ariane 5 rocket, made by the European Space Agency, from French Guiana in October 2018. 'Just as Hubble rewrote all the textbooks, Webb will rewrite it again,' said Greenhouse.

10416,"Veterinarians have criticised EU rules on organic farming that demands that fish are treated with homoeopathic remedies. In line with EU regulations, the first line of treatment for organic fish should be 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution', before . British and Norwegian vets have called the directives 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' 'Risk': Under EU regulations, organic farmers must first use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution' to treat ill fish, which has been criticised by British and Norwegian vets (stock image) The directives, outlined in the 2009 European regulation on organic aquaculture, are set to be brought into national law in non-EU Norway, which has caused vets to see red. Section 7 of the regulations calls for organic farmers to use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homoeopathic dilution', as their first port of call when their fish are ill . After this, the 'veterinary treatments' section outlines that farmers may use  'plants and their extracts not having anaesthetic effects'. As well as the directive to use homeopathic treatments, organic fish farmers are only allowed to resort to mainstream medical treatments a maximum of twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification. This has been criticised by the  Norwegian Veterinary Association (NVA) as could mean that fish are not getting the correct treatment in time, causing them unnecessary suffering. Danger: British and Norwegian vets have called the EU directives on organic fish treatment 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment' 'We think it's totally unacceptable from a scientific point of view because there's no scientific basis for using homeopathy,' Ellef Blakstad, the head of the Norwegian Veterinary Association, told The Local.no. 'If you start using homeopathy, you prolong the time when the animals are not getting adequate treatment and that's a threat to animal welfare.' Harsh: Farmers are only allowed to use mainstream medical treatments a twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification (stock image) The criticism from Norway has been echoed by the British Veterinary Association, saying use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' The British Veterinary Association (BVA) cannot endorse the use of homeopathic remedies, or indeed any products, making therapeutic claims, which have no proven efficacy,' British Veterinary Association President John Blackwell told MailOnline. 'As with any treatment for disease using medicines, BVA believes that veterinary medicinal products must be evidence-based, with any medicinal claims made by a manufacturer supported. 'If homeopathic remedies are used without proven effectiveness on farmed fish across the EU, including the UK, the consequence could be serious animal health and welfare detriment, which would be counterproductive to both animal health and to the farmed fish industry in the UK.' Homepathic treatments are based on the principle that 'like cures like', whereby a highly diluted substance that causes the symptoms  in a healthy person, can also cure similar symptoms in a sick person. A 2010 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report on homeopathy said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos, and that the principles on which homeopathy is based are 'scientifically implausible'.","Norwegian vets criticise EU regulations on treatment of organic fish . First line of treatment for organic fish should be homeopathic remedy . Vets call directives 'scientifically illiterate', saying it delays real care .

21,"(CNN)If you're famous and performing the American national anthem, be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace. Facts are facts.  Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Sure, he can shred it on ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" and ""Dr. Feelgood,"" but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession.  There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV.  In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it ""disgraceful."" There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.  Overly wrought songs are his specialty and he doesn't disappoint in that department when he sings at the American League Championship Series in 2003.  Bolton belts it out, but there's one little problem -- the words.  Can anyone say crib notes?",Singing the national anthem is a risky proposition . Whitney Houston nailed it; Roseanne Barr destroyed it .,"Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminds us again of dangers of tackling ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work .

52,"(CNN)According to an outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors, ""(a)n institutional failure at Rolling Stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia."" The Columbia team concluded that ""The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking."" Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, ""We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students."" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is: . Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that ""the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent."" ""Actionable"" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers ""true."" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were ""of or concerning"" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is ""concerning"" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about ""a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue."" If I said, ""The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals"" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the ""small group"" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are ""between jobs,"" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.","An outside review found that a Rolling Stone article about campus rape was ""deeply flawed"" Danny Cevallos says that there are obstacles to a successful libel case, should one be filed .","UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus can sue for defamation . the Virginia Supreme Court says that ""the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent"" Defamatory statements about a group are not actionable by individual members, but there are exceptions .",0.2117647058823529,0.048192771084337345,0.1176470588235294

2169,"He was the goalkeeper who only won his place in the side on the back of a teammate shipping an embarrassing eight, so when Costel Pantilimon conceded four goals inside 45 minutes he feared the worst – for himself and the club’s top-flight status. That was four weeks ago when Aston Villa ran riot at the Stadium of Light and Sunderland were booed from the field at half-time before thousands of fans streamed for the exits. Within 48 hours Gus Poyet had been sacked and Dick Advocaat was being installed. The Dutch boss celebrated his first home match with a 1-0 victory over Newcastle last weekend, a result which moved the Black Cats three points clear of the relegation zone ahead of this afternoon’s visit of Crystal Palace. Sunderland Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon celebrates Jermain Defoe's goal against Newcastle United . Pantilimon kept his place despite pressure from Vito Mannone - the man who was dropped in the wake of October’s 8-0 defeat at Southampton – and the Romanian stopper admits there has been a definite mood change under Advocaat. ‘Before the new manager came, our confidence was not in a good way,’ said the 28-year-old, who was a Premier League winner with Manchester City in 2012 and again last season. ‘We were playing very badly, but now we have a new motivation. He’s brought the enjoyment back. ‘I never expected to play in a game like the 4-0 loss at home to Aston Villa. I was upset. You start to think about what you did wrong. The former Manchester City goalkeeper celebrates with teammate Santiago Vergini at the Stadium of Light . ‘We had to change something. It wasn’t easy. I thought about relegation after the Villa game. ‘I was asking myself, “What is happening?”. We couldn’t win games at home. Away from home we were taking points, but in front of our fans we were failing. 'It was strange and very frustrating. I didn’t know what we could do to be better.’ The answer, it appears, was Advocaat. ‘He has tried to bring us together as a group,’ explained Pantilimon, who has so far avoided one of Advocaat’s infamous fines for a lack of punctuality. ‘We all eat lunch together as a team. That should be normal. It’s a good idea, it creates a stronger group. It means we get to know each other better and other people’s situations. Pantilimon rolls the ball out to a defender as Sunderland beat Newcastle at the Stadium of Light . ‘On the pitch, he wants us to be aggressive all the time, but also keep the ball a lot more. ‘Before the derby he reminded us that not many people have the opportunity to play in a game like this. I think these words said everything, the motivation was at 100 per cent. ‘The atmosphere last week reminded me a lot of how it was after City won the league (in 2012). ‘It was incredible. My wife and my parents were there and they loved the game.’ Both of Pantilimon’s parents are deaf and the keeper uses sign language to communicate. Indeed, it was some advice from his father which set him on his way to a career between the posts. The Romanian shot-stopper celebrates a Sunderland win with his team-mates against Newcastle . ‘I was a striker when I started playing as a child because I liked scoring goals,’ said 6ft 8ins Pantilimon, who was raised in Bacau at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. ‘My father told me it was better to go in goal. He said I had the physical attributes to play there. ‘But I was not always so tall. I had a period between 14 and 16 when I grew so fast. ‘Thankfully, I didn’t like basketball so much. When I was about 15 I realised I could be a professional goalkeeper. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat enjoyed his first victory as manager in the derby game with Newcastle . ‘I was only 16 when I made my debut for a professional club. It was a third division club, but it was young to make my debut at that level. ‘I was always confident I could be a goalkeeper. I thought I could get right to the top, I’ve worked hard to be here and I don’t want to stop, I want to get better and better.’ Under Advocaat, things are certainly looking up, for Pantilimon and Sunderland.",Costel Pantilimon believes the good times have returned to the club .

5963,"A lesbian honors student who was told by her school principal that she was not allowed to wear a tuxedo to her senior prom has now been informed that she may wear the attire, it has emerged. Claudetteia Love, 17, said last week that she and her friends would not go to Carroll High School's prom in Monroe, Louisiana, because Principal Patrick Taylor had told her she had to wear a dress. Her comments sparked an outpouring of support from across the country - from her classmates, who signed a petition to persuade the school to change its mind, to gay rights groups and strangers. But now, Principal Taylor and Monroe City School Board President Rodney McFarland - who had backed Claudetteia - have reportedly told the student that she can wear a tux to the prom after all. Result! Claudetteia Love (pictured), 17, was told by her school principal that she was not allowed to wear a tuxedo to her senior prom. However, she has now been informed that she may wear the attire after all . On Tuesday, the National Center for Lesbian Rights said in a news release that the pair had contacted the teenager to inform her of their decision relating to the event on April 24. In the release, Claudetteia, who is openly gay, said she had been inspired by the countless supportive comments and offers she has received in the wake of her controversial tuxedo ban. The support included a local businessman's offer to create a prom for her and her friends, and a letter sent to school superintendents in the state by the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. “The outpouring of support has been incredible and inspiring; it is a source of strength that I will keep with me as I move on the next phase of my education and life beyond high school,' said Claudetteia. She added she was 'thankful' for the school's latest decision. 'I am looking forward to celebrating the end of my senior year with my friends and classmates at the prom, like any other student,' she said. Last week, Claudetteia's mother, Geraldine Jackson, who is 'fully supportive' of her daughter's gay identity, said Principal Taylor had told her staff would not supervise the prom if girls wore tuxes. Principal: Claudetteia said last week that she and her friends would not go to Carroll High School's prom in Monroe, Louisiana, because Principal Patrick Taylor (pictured) had told her she had to wear a dress . Release: But now, Principal Taylor and school board president Rodney McFarland have told the student she can wear a tux to the prom, according to a news release (pictured) by the National Center for Lesbian Rights . 'That's his exact words. ""Girls wear dresses and boys wear tuxes, and that's the way it is"",' she told The News-Star, adding that staff members had not acted on the petition started by students. Meanwhile, Claudetteia told the newspaper: 'I told my mom, ""They're using me"". They put me in all these honors and advanced placement classes so I can take all of these tests and get good grades and better the school, but when it's time for me to celebrate the fact that I've accomplished what I need to accomplish and I'm about to graduate, they don't want to let me do it the way I want to.' She added: 'There are people in the world that won't accept you but they don't have to be so judgmental and make you feel like you're less of a person and that you shouldn't express yourself.' Ms Jackson and Claudetteia are both now 'very happy' after Caroll High School reversed its ban. Inspired: In the release, Claudetteia (left and right), who is openly gay, said she had been inspired by the countless supportive comments and offers she has received in the wake of her controversial tuxedo ban . Last week, Principal Taylor told the News-Star that the earlier decision was part of the school's dress code and not anything personal. However, Claudetteia and her family said they did not believe it. McFarland told the paper that Principal Taylor's stance was not backed up by board policy. 'Banning her from her prom just because of what she wants to wear - that's discrimination,' he said. 'As far as I know there is no Monroe City School Board policy saying what someone has to wear to attend the prom. You can't just go making up policies.' McFarland said he planned to ask Superintendent Brent Vidrine to talk to Principal Taylor. School: Claudetteia is a top-performing student at Carroll High School (pictured) She will represent the school at an annual scholars' banquet and has a full scholarship to Jackson State University once she graduates . In Tuesday's release, NCLR Executive Director Kate Kendell said: 'We are pleased to hear Principal Taylor and the Monroe City School Board corrected this wrong before any serious harm was done. 'Forbidding girls from wearing a tuxedo to the prom would have served no purpose other than to reinforce the worst sorts of harmful stereotypes and censor a core part of Claudetteia’s identity.' Last year, Claudetteia was one of a group of students presented in a Monroe City School Board meeting as part of the school's high achieving medical magnet program.

In an intensely personal interview, he revealed: 'We weren't falling out with each other, but we were falling apart just coping with the nights and everything.' His comments were echoed by his wife who, in a separate interview, said the stresses of looking after Ivan pushed their relationship close to 'breaking point'. Scroll down for video .

Ivan (pictured) was born with Ohtahara Syndrome, a rare brain disorder which left him in a wheelchair, needing to be fed through a tube and suffering from cerebral palsy and severe epileptic fits. He died aged six in 2009 . In a tearful interview, Mrs Cameron spoke for the first time of the 'nightmare' of learning that their first child had a rare disorder which left him needing round-the-clock care. Within a year, she said, looking after him had left the Camerons 'totally shattered' and trying to 'find a way through'. And she described the shock of his sudden death, which came 'out of the blue'. Ivan was born with Ohtahara Syndrome, a rare brain disorder which left him in a wheelchair, needing to be fed through a tube and suffering from cerebral palsy and severe epileptic fits. He died aged six in 2009. Speaking days ahead of what would have been his 13th birthday on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said: 'It's true – it is a knock. You are exhausted. You become a part-time parent, nurser, carer, doctor.' Mrs Cameron recalled how within days of Ivan's birth she knew 'something wasn't quite right' because he was making 'funny, jerky movements'. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday – which pictured her at home in Downing Street with her husband and their other children – she said: 'It's your worst nightmare. They did a whole load of tests, they push the box of tissues towards you and you feel like you're in an episode of Casualty.'

He cradled the young animal to feed it milk from a bottle after dropping in at Dean Lane Farm in his Witney constituency in Oxfordshire. At one point they were snuggled up so close that they were nuzzling each other’s faces. Inevitably, it prompted a flurry of comments on Twitter, several from Labour supporters, many of them unrepeatable and several referring to mint sauce. David Cameron took a break from the campaign trail yesterday to feed a newborn, orphaned lamb in Witney . The diagnosis had 'frightening' and 'scary' implications, she said, adding: 'It changes your life for ever. It's tough, lonely and isolating. You are terrified of not being able to cope.' She praised her 'amazing, strong and steady' husband and his 'sense that it's going to be OK'. Mr Cameron, in a separate interview with the Sunday Times, said Ivan was a 'blessing in lots of ways' but admitted the strains he created on their life left them both 'falling apart'. He said: 'It takes over your life. We both worked out that we could cope, and find a way through this.' In a frank admission of the pressures their son's condition had placed on their relationship, Mrs Cameron said: 'There's lots of people in our situation whose marriages don't survive. 'Looking after a disabled child pushes you to the limits of what you can cope with physically, emotionally. By the end of the first year we were totally shattered and pretty much at breaking point.

The Prime Minister’s wife has a leaping dolphin on her right foot which she had done during a gap year spent travelling in Indonesia following her A-levels. Asked how she would feel if her children followed her example, she told the Mail on Sunday: ‘I’d be fine about it. ‘Obviously you’d have to explain that they might not want it in certain places where it would be for ever. But no, I wouldn’t have any problem with them having a tattoo.’ 'The doctors realised we needed help. But as parents you have this feeling that you shouldn't ask for help.' She added that they were 'so, so proud' of Ivan, saying: 'He was very beautiful, one of the great gifts in our lives. A day when you haven't been to hospital, a day when he smiled, or a day when you haven't cried, becomes the most amazing day.' She described her battles with education bosses who tried to send Ivan to a mainstream school, before his parents secured him a place at a special needs school. 'Ivan had a feeding tube, very bad epilepsy. He couldn't sit up. He couldn't communicate at all. He needed to be somewhere more sensory and stimulating with people who knew how to look after him,' she said. His death came as a big shock. 'It was totally out of the blue and happened so quickly,' she said. 'It takes a long time before you see sunlight poking through the dark fog but never does the pain go as it's so connected to the love.' She said she still receives some bereavement counselling. Mr Cameron also spoke of Ivan's death: 'Your whole world collapses. You push pause on your life; you stop and have a think. Nothing really matters at that stage.' In her interview Mrs Cameron also revealed that her taste in music includes US psychedelic band Polica, whose latest album Shulamith has on its cover a topless woman with her back turned and her hair and neck covered in blood. Mrs Cameron saw the band perform in London when they toured Britain. The album is named after Canadian Marxist Shulamith Firestone, the author of The Dialectic Of Sex: The Case For A Feminist Revolution. Mrs Cameron also told of her embarrassment at being told Nancy and Elwen were having a 'huge pillow and duvet fight' when the family stayed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at her schloss near Berlin in 2013. This picture - from a new set of photographs showing the Camerons at home in Downing Street - has a clear message: That while the Prime Minister has been holding down the most important job in Britain for the past five years, he’s also made time to learn the all-important art of tying up his daughter’s hair for school. Showing that being left-handed is no handicap, he holds four-year-old Florence’s hair with one hand while brushing with the other. Behind them, the dishwasher looks suspiciously empty in the midst of the morning chaos inevitable in the home of any family of five, but reaching down to it provides the Prime Minister’s wife with an opportunity to show off her enviable figure . While this battered ministerial red box may have carried some of the most important documents in British history, as it lies around in the Cameron household it becomes the perfect toy. In this previously unseen 2011 family photograph of Florence as a toddler, she fits perfectly into the box as it sits perched on the yellow sofa from the Fancy Nancy range at sofaworks.com (£1,579). Tucked behind it appears to be a label from one of daddy’s trips to Brussels. And behind Florence, standing on the chest of drawers, is a Ribbon Copper Large Table Lamp from Habitat (£160) and a rattan tissue box cover (£26) from Oka . Breakfast and the family enjoy porridge – the pot is on the table in front of Mrs Cameron, who wears a cashmere grey, red and white Chinti and Parker sweater (£295).

10487,"Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia put on a united front today, as they stepped out for the first time since explosive new claims about the 47-year-old monarch's father emerged. According to a new book by a former royal correspondent, the former King Juan Carlos II had a long-running affair with a German socialite during the final decade of his reign. But if Felipe and Letizia were upset about the revelations, they certainly weren't showing it as they arrived at the University of Alcala de Henares to present the Cervantes Prize for Literature. Scroll down for video . Claims: King Felipe and Queen Letizia present a united front following the latest Spanish royal scandal . Walking arm-in-arm with his 42-year-old wife, King Felipe, who took the Spanish throne last June, kept a straight face as he approached photographers. Later, as a group of ukulele-wielding students appeared to serenade the royal couple, Felipe even managed a small smile. Well-hidden though any private anguish may have been, the news will have undoubtedly come as a blow to the Spanish royal who has been attempting to overhaul the image of the monarchy in Spain since taking the throne. His father Juan-Carlos was famous for his love of freebies, even, on one occasion, accepting a yacht called Fortuna as a gift. Not good: A new book by journalist Ana Romero (left) says King Juan-Carlos had a decade-long affair . Divorce: It also claimed that Juan-Carlos contemplated divorcing Felipe's mother, Queen Sofia . Unruffled: The Spanish royal couple kept any worries about the allegations under wraps during the visit . Light relief: Felipe managed a small smile while being serenaded by a group of student musicians . In June 2012, with the Spanish economy in crisis and unemployment running at close to 50 per cent among the young, Juan-Carlos was photographed enjoying a lavish hunting safari in Botswana. The trip, which was not announced in advance, only became known to Spanish taxpayers when the 77-year-old was injured and had to charter a special plane in order to get home. Juan-Carlos' African jaunt, a freebie paid for by Syrian businessman Mohamed Eyad Kayali, led to widespread calls for his abdication, which he did less than a year later. Since taking the Spanish throne, Felipe has introduced a new code of conduct  which  bans royals from accepting lavish gifts and also outlaws private business activity - the latter in response to a fraud scandal that  enmeshed his sister Infanta Cristina in 2010. He has also included a stipulation that insists members of the Spanish royal family behave at all times in ways likely to 'please' and 'earn them the gratitude of'  the public. Blow: The  scandal is a set-back for Felipe who has been trying to change public perception of the monarchy . Freebies: Felipe's new rules include banning all royals, among them wife Letizia, from taking freebies . Behaviour: Royals are expected to behave in a way that earns them the gratitude of the Spanish public . Despite Felipe's best efforts, his father's legacy remains troublesome - in particular his record of extramarital affairs. Most recently, a Belgian woman named Ingrid Sartiau filed a paternity suit against him - a case only made possible because of his abdication. Juan-Carlos is also believed to have a second illegitimate son, Alberto Sola who was born in 1956 and lives in Barcelona. The latest scandal focuses on the final decade of his reign with Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, a German 28 years his junior, claiming to have had a lengthy affair with the royal. Speaking to Ana Romero, a former royal correspondent and the author of a new book called Final De Partida [End Game], Ms Sayn-Wittgenstein claimed that Juan-Carlos had contemplated divorcing his wife Queen Sofia in order to marry her.","King Felipe was making his first appearance since the claims emerged . New book alleges his father had a 10-year affair with a German socialite . Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein claims Juan-Carlos wanted to marry her .

6914,"An honest taxi driver has made a friend for life after returning a bag a passenger left on the back seat of his car - containing £10,000 in cash. Mohammed Nisar, 55, had been driving sole trader Adrian Quinn to Walsall train station when the passenger hopped out of the vehicle in a rush, forgetting his rucksack. He had been carrying the hefty sum of money after cashing a cheque from his inheritance following the death of his mother - and on realising his mistake says he felt 'dazed'. Reward: Taxi driver Mohammed Nisar (left) accepts a reward from sole trader Adrian Quinn after returning a bag the passenger left in his taxi containing £10,000 in cash . Mr Quinn, 46, of Hereford, said: 'Losing that money would have been the end of my business. I was physically sick! He realised he had left the bag in the car just seconds after Mr Nisar dropped him at the station. He added: 'I was walking across the car park when I realised I hadn't got my bag and I panicked. I tried to flag down another taxi but they all had fares. 'I was sick. My body just went into shut-down and I didn't know what to do.. I was just in a daze. If I'd lost that bag it would have been the end of my business. 'We have built it up from nothing for the last nine years and we are sole traders. We don't have the backing of banks. It is hard work, but it earns us a living.' After eventually flagging down another cab the father-of-three arrived back at the taxi rank in a flustered state to find Mr Nisar sitting in his car with the bag safely on the passenger seat. Honest cabbie: Mr Nisar believes 'honesty is the best policy' and has returned a number of valuable lost items to passengers in the past . He said: 'I was very emotional. I said, ""Do you know what was in that bag? Put it this way, it is not a box of sandwiches or a newspaper. There is £10,000 in there"".' Mr Quinn gave Mohammed a cash reward to thank him - in an envelope marked 'to my best friend in the world' - and has even invited him and his wife to his home for a family meal. Mr Nisar, 55, said: 'He nearly had a heart attack, he was really worried! 'He came up to me and asked if I realised what was in the bag. He was very, very thankful. He had just bought a car but forgot the bag full of money.' It is not the first time Mr Nisar, who has been a self-employed taxi driver for 15 years, has found things in the back of his car. Only two years ago one passenger left a wallet containing £150 in, but Mohammed drove straight back to the man's home to return it. New friend: Mr Quinn hands a cash reward to Mr Nisar in an envelope labelled 'to my best friend in the world' Now, following his latest find, he is urging fellow taxi drivers to do the same if they find themselves in the same situation. Mohammed said: 'At the end of the day honesty is the best policy. There are some drivers who don't return things but what is the point? 'If the council had not have called me and no-one had have claimed it after 12 or 24 hours I would have taken that bag straight to the police station. 'Mobile phones are the most common thing left behind but most of them now can be traced anyway. 'My message is to encourage all my taxi driving brothers that if they find something valuable just give it back.'",Mohammed Nisar had been taking Adrian Quinn to Walsall train station .

11070,"It is not the first advertising billboard in which a company has used the image of a svelte, bikini-clad model to sell its wares and it probably won’t be the last. But something about this poster for Protein World diet supplements has struck a collective raw nerve. The company is facing a massive backlash over its billboard campaign — including vandalised posters, a petition, a protest rally and even a bomb threat. Scroll down for video . Protein World's billboard campaign advertising diet supplements features a svelte bikini-clad model asking 'Are you beach body ready?' Campaigners launched a scathing attack on the protein supplement company after the advert — which features a toned model posing with the slogan ‘Are you beach body ready?’ — began appearing on the London Underground three weeks ago. The ‘body shaming’ campaign has seen many of its posters defaced with feminist slogans, more than 50,000 people sign a petition to have them removed and a demonstration planned for this weekend in protest. But yesterday the company’s marketing boss claimed the firm is ‘just trying to make the nation healthier’. Richard Staveley, Protein World’s head of global marketing, added: ‘It’s been a brilliant campaign for us and I don’t see us changing anything dramatically any time soon.’ Richard Staveley, Protein World’s head of global marketing revealed that the company has received bomb threats in the wake of the campaign but said it had been 'brilliant' and that he didn't see the company changing . On ITV’s Good Morning Britain yesterday, presenter Susanna Reid, 44, admitted that, like many women, she finds the advert ‘a little bit anxiety-inducing' On ITV’s Good Morning Britain yesterday, presenter Susanna Reid, 44, admitted that, like many women, she finds the advert ‘a little bit anxiety-inducing’. And the Advertising Standards Authority confirmed it had received 277 complaints, with many commenting that ‘the advert is offensive, irresponsible and harmful because it promotes an unhealthy body image’. Posters have been vandalised with feminist messages such as ‘Your body is not a commodity’. Photographs of the amended signs have gone viral online. Despite the controversy, earlier in the week the company announced on Twitter it had made sales of £1 million and attracted 20,000 new customers in just four days following the advert’s release. Protein World has taken a strong stance on social media during the furore and has posted blunt replies to complaints on Twitter, including ‘why make your insecurities our problem’ and ‘grow up’. The company’s CEO and founder, Arjun Seth, has even branded the people defacing his adverts ‘terrorists’, ‘irrational and extremist’. But the poster has struck a collective raw nerve with many of the billboards being vandalised with people writing messages reinforcing that every 'body' of any shape, size and age is ready for the beach -  such as #eachbodysready . Pictured of the defaced posters have appeared on Facebook, such as this which someone had covered with a note which reads: '1 You're body is fine just as it is. 2 Whatever it looks like your body is not a commodity #Everybody's ready #Everyday sexism' Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Mr Staveley said his company had received a series of threats, including one to bomb its head office. He said: ‘First, we’ve been inundated, as you’ve probably seen from our Twitter feed and Facebook, of people defacing adverts, ripping them down and climbing over rail tracks to graffiti them. ‘That’s criminal behaviour. I think that’s quite extreme behaviour. ‘We’ve actually had threats on our head office, physical, violent threats. We had a bomb threat.’ More than 52,300 people have signed a petition demanding the adverts are removed. Demonstrators plan to congregate at London’s Hyde Park on Saturday for a protest dubbed ‘Taking back the beach’. On a Facebook page calling on people to attend the demonstration, a post reads: ‘The idea that your body should be hidden away if it doesn’t meet these bizarrely specific requirements . . . I’m over it.’ The company is facing a massive backlash over its billboard campaign — including vandalised posters, a petition, a protest rally and even a bomb threat . More than 50,000 people have already signed a petition to have them removed and a demonstration planned for this weekend in protest . When Miss Reid asked Mr Staveley about claims the posters make women feel anxious, he replied: ‘We’re advertising our weight-loss collection. That’s what millions of people are aspiring to do in time for their summer holiday — to lose a bit of weight, feel a bit healthier and get fitter. It’s not a new concept.’ He confirmed the model in the picture, Australian Renee Somerfield, 23, had achieved her enviable physique using Protein World products, and denied the image had been retouched or altered. A spokesman for Transport for London said the adverts will be taken down from today — not because of the controversy, but because they have ‘come to the end of their natural three-week advertising lifespan’. Sioned Quirke, a specialist dietitian based in South Wales, said: ‘Some people do find that increasing their protein intake can aid weight loss. ‘But generally, taking a supplement or diet pill will not do all the work for you. ‘Also, these kinds of products are not regulated or monitored, so you can never be 100 per cent sure what is actually in them.’ Online fitness store Protein World, who claim that the image is entirely unPhotoshopped, have been actively engaging in the furore on social media, strongly defending their campaign with some biting responses to aggrieved Tweeters .","Protein World's billboard features a svelte bikini-clad model asking 'Are you beach body ready?'

996,"(CNN)A Florida judge denied a motion by two women to join a lawsuit against Prince Andrew and a prominent U.S. lawyer that alleged  underage sex crimes. Lawyer Alan Dershowitz  was accused of having sex with minors with help from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Buckingham Palace denied the allegations, which surfaced in a court filing in January. So did Dershowitz. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- ""Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4"" -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without consulting them. Marra wrote in the decision that the ""lurid details"" of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit. ""The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim ... especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken."" Speaking of the allegations against him, Dershowitz said Tuesday: ""I hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up, and, nobody should believe them."" Buckingham Palace, which in January emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the Duke of York and a victim it identified as Virginia Roberts,  said Prince Andrew was informed of the latest developments. ""He is spending this week privately, before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week. Further details will be announced in due course,"" the palace said in a statement. Roberts' attorneys were not immediately available for comment. The federal court filing alleged that ""Doe 3"" was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager. Virginia Roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media, and Buckingham Palace included it in a statement. Along with Britain's Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through Epstein. Epstein, an investment banker, pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation, but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement. But some of Epstein's alleged victims aren't on board with the deal, thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties. Four of them took federal prosecutors to court, suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated by the agreement. Two of them entered the discussion in January, including the one described as Jane Doe 3. The filing alleged she was a minor when Epstein made her a ""sex slave"" and made ""her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people."" Those big names allegedly included Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. According to the filing, ""Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands."" The celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial, saying the case ""is all about money"" and ""completely made up."" He went further in his court filings, including a sworn affidavit in which he said ""lawyers for Jane Doe #3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably."" ""Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3,"" he said. Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein's Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein's New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. ""Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,"" he stated, ""that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3."" CNN's Greg Botelho, Steve Almasy, Javier de Diego, Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Judge also throws out bombshell sex claims against lawyer Alan Dershowitz .

11021,"The Kansas City Royals and Chicago White Sox each lost Saturday without playing a game. Four members of the Royals and three from the White Sox were punished for their roles in a series-opening brawl and six of the players drew suspensions. Major League Baseball placed the blame for the fighting squarely on both teams. Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura was handed a seven-game suspension, fellow starter Edinson Volquez given five games and outfielder Lorenzo Cain and reliever Kelvin Herrera got two games apiece. White Sox pitchers Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija were suspended five games each, while catcher Tyler Flowers escaped suspension but joined the others in getting an undisclosed fine. Mass brawl: Chicago White Sox's Jeff Samardzija (center) in the brawl with Kansas City Royals players during the seventh inning of Thursday's game. Smardzija and five others have been suspended as a result . All-in: Each player   ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and a few punches . Several punches were thrown and Kansas City's Ventura, Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez were ejected along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija (pictured going down) The Royals have not said whether they plan to appeal their punishments, which would begin with Sunday's series finale because of a rainout Saturday. Sale and Samardzija plan to appeal. 'I think everybody had some elements of their behavior over the course of that incident on both sides that they wish they handled differently,' White Sox general manager Rick Hahn said during a conference call Saturday. 'Respect the fact that our players stood up and took responsibility for their actions and expressed remorse over those things they wish had been handled better. 'It is something that happens from time to time,' Hahn added. 'It's part of the game.' It's a costly part of the game, though. Along with the suspensions, Hahn said reliever Matt Albers fractured a finger on his throwing hand in the melee and will go on the disabled list. Meanwhile, Herrera is already awaiting an appeal on a five-game suspension that was handed down after he threw a pitch behind Oakland third baseman Brett Lawrie during a series last weekend. Ventura was fined for hitting Lawrie with a 99 mph fastball during the same series. 'We understand that Major League Baseball has to do what they think is fair in situations like this,' Royals manager Ned Yost said in a team statement. 'Now, we just have to wait for the appeals process to play out.' Suspended: Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura (left) was handed a seven-game suspension, fellow starter Edinson Volquez (right) given five games . Punished: Both outfielder Lorenzo Cain (left) and reliever Kelvin Herrera (right) were suspended for two games . White Sox: White Sox pitchers Chris Sale (left) and Jeff Samardzija (right) were suspended five games each . Tensions between the Royals and White Sox had been building since the opening series of the season, when the teams combined to hit six batters. Two more were plunked early Thursday night when Ventura hit Jose Abreu in the fourth inning and Sale hit Mike Moustakas in the fifth. The simmering anger finally boiled over in the seventh, when Ventura snagged a grounder from Chicago outfielder Adam Eaton and the two exchanged words before Eaton was thrown out at first. Eaton had to be restrained from Ventura, who was ejected from his second straight start. 'It was a messy situation,' Ventura said through a translator. Players from both dugouts and bullpens then ran onto the field. Volquez whiffed throwing a haymaker, and several other players threw punches in a fight that lasted several minutes. 'There are real negative repercussions of this,' Hahn said.' After he was thrown from the game, Sale went to the Royals clubhouse and was seen pounding on the door. While nothing more transpired, Hahn said he spoke to his star pitcher about it Friday. 'It was a private conversation,' Hahn said. 'We certainly understand where Chris was coming from in terms of the emotion involved in the moment and what he was hoping to accomplish, and at the same time realizing that perhaps there was a better way to handle these things going forward.' Five players ultimately were ejected from Thursday night's game, which the Royals won in 13 innings. Among them was Cain, who has been hit by pitches four times this season. Moustakas and teammate Alex Gordon have been hit an AL-leading five times apiece, and the Royals have been hit 17 times as a team - tied with Texas for the league lead entering the day. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight after the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field, Illinois . 'This game's emotional and it seems to follow them around,' said White Sox manager Robin Ventura, who famously charged the mound and was pummeled by the Rangers' Nolan Ryan during a game in 1993. 'Everybody gets emotional and reacts to things and that's what happened.' The Royals are starting to earn a fighting reputation. Along with their two series with the White Sox and a tense three-game set in Oakland, Ventura got into a heated argument with Angels slugger Mike Trout during a series in Los Angeles. While acknowledging that the Royals must do a better job of containing their emotions, Yost insisted that his club has rarely been the instigator in a string of testy situations. 'Hopefully it's all behind us,' he said Thursday night, 'and we can move forward.' The teams played eight innings Friday night without incident, but the rest of the game was postponed due to rain with the score 2-2. It was supposed to resume Saturday, but more rain in Chicago means that it will now resume Sunday with the Royals batting in the top of the ninth. John Danks is scheduled to start for the White Sox in the second game Sunday, while fellow left-hander Jason Vargas is expected to go for the Royals.

8820,"A restaurant which accidentally served an alcoholic drink to a 10-year-old girl has blamed the mix-up on her mother for leaving her daughter on her own to go out for a cigarette. Ashley Dodds, 29, visited the Red Hot World Buffet on Deansgate, Manchester, with her daughter, Dennon, and her daughter's friend. After ordering a non-alcoholic Sweet Kiss 'mocktail' for the girls, Ms Dodds was disgusted when she heard that her daughter had actually been drinking an alcoholic version. The menu: Ashley Dodds, 29, holds up the 'mocktails' list she ordered drinks from for daughter Dennon at the Red Hot World Buffet in  Manchester. Restaurant staff accidentally served the girl a drink with alcohol in it . Restaurant bosses admitted to making the mistake but blamed the incident on Ms Dodds for leaving her daughter alone while she went for a cigarette. Ms Dodds, from Salford, said: 'It is unbelievable. They are so unprofessional. 'How dare they blame it on me. It makes me out to be a bad mother but they made the mistake.' Explaining what happened, she added: 'I ordered my daughter and her friend Sweet Kisses, and a bit later me and my friend decided to go for a cigarette. 'I went to the counter to ask for two more Sweet Kisses to be taken over to them, then went downstairs for a cigarette. When I came back up my daughter just blurted out saying ""mum, I've had alcohol"".' Dining out: Inside the Red Hot World Buffet in Deansgate, Manchester. The restaurant admitted to the mishap but blamed Ms Dodds for leaving her daughter and a friend unattended and going outside for a cigarette . Ms Dodds, who works at a Nando's restaurant, was horrified to learn that instead of Sweet Kisses, staff at the Red Hot World Buffet had placed two Sex on the Beach cocktails in front of the girls while the adults were away from the table. She said: 'I took a big swig of the drink and thought, wow these have alcohol in them. I was baffled why there wasn't a manager out to explain what had happened.' The order had been mistaken for a non-alcoholic Safe Sex on the Beach, but accidentally made as a normal Sex on the Beach with vodka. The unhappy mother, who said she tries to shelter Dennon from anything too adult for her age, also thinks mocktail menus should not be alluding to anything sexual. Poor service: Ms Dodds with her receipt from the Red Hot World Buffet, which shows the two Safe Sex on the Beach cocktails she ordered after visiting the restaurant . The Red Hot World Buffet said: 'We did serve something wrong, however putting it into context the issue was the lady went outside for a cigarette and left the children unattended. We were quite bothered by that' 'I wouldn't even let Dennon look at the menu because it said Sex on the Beach, and a Virgin Mojito, and I don't want her reading that stuff,' she said. 'I don't even want her thinking about that kind of stuff. 'I told the manager that at the end of the day the mocktail menu is non-alcoholic so you are mainly aiming at children, but was told that wasn't necessarily the case.' A spokesman for Red Hot World Buffet said: 'We did serve something wrong, however putting it into context the issue was the lady went outside for a cigarette and left the children unattended. 'We were quite bothered by that as it's quite unusual to leave two small children out of sight. This was an accident and there was some confusion with the order, but there is a responsibility for parents to stay with their children.'","Ashley Dodds, 29, left speechless when daughter told her what happened .

The comedian tweeted a picture on Thursday alongside former England captain David Beckham and New York Giants' NFL hotshot Odell Beckham Jnr. Accompanied with the caption: 'Double Beckhams!' Corden was all smiles as he posed in between the duo. James Corden (centre) posted a picture alongside Odell Beckham Jnr (left) and David Beckham via Twitter . Both Beckhams, who are of no relation, were pictured in America with the 36-year-old - who is currently filming late-night talk show Late Late in the States. Last month David Beckham lifted the lid on his son Brooklyn's first date, in which the former Manchester United midfielder watched on from a nearby table in a London restaurant. Speaking as a guest on Corden's show, the ex-Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star told the hilarious story of his 16-year-old son's first foray into the world of dating. When probed by Corden, who asked, 'He must be getting quite big into the dating circuit now?', Beckham replied: ''Yeah, it's happening. He's going to hate me for this. 'I'm fine with it, because on his first date - when he was about 14 and a half - it was Valentine's Day so he said, ""I'd love to take this girl to dinner."" David Beckham embarrassed his son Brooklyn on James Corden's Late Late Show in America last month . Brooklyn watched on from the audience as his father told the story of his first date, at a sushi bar in London . 'I said, ""Okay, great."" I spoke to Victoria, and she was like, ""Really?"", so I said, ""Yeah, he's going to do it."" 'She said, ""Okay, make sure you take him and then make sure you sit in the restaurant."" So I was like, ""Really, you're going to make me do that?"" and she said ""Yeah, that's the only way I'm going to let him go.""' 'So we took him to a small sushi restaurant and he sat at the sushi bar and I sat about five tables back. By the way, my daughter is four years old. When she gets to that age, I will be closer than that!' Beckham's son Brooklyn, who was sat in the audience as his dad retold the embarrassing story, is aiming to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming a professional footballer. This season, he has been playing for Arsenal's Under 16s but was recently dealt a blow with the news that the Gunners will not hand him a new deal at the end of the season.

8307,"Chaos over Labour's plan to target wealthy foreigners has left even Ed Miliband's own family baffled. Mike Keen, the Labour leader's cousin, said he was 'officially confused' over whether or not the party was actually promising to scrap non-dom rules. Mr Miliband used a speech yesterday to say he would 'abolish' the 200-year-old rule for non-doms, but in January Ed Balls said it would cost the country money. Mike Keen, the Labour leader's cousin, said he was 'officially confused' over whether or not the Ed Miliband was actually promising to scrap non-dom rules . Mr Keen posted on his public Facebook page that he needed someone to explain to him just what the Labour policy was . Non-domicile status allows people living and working in Britain to only pay tax on their UK income, but not earnings from overseas. They must prove that they regard a foreign country as their real home. But Mr Miliband argues that non-dom tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad. Newspaper reports suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by Labour altogether. But  it emerged Labour would allow 'real temporary residents' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on should they take power in the General Election on May 7. In a speech in Warwick yesterday, Mr Miliband said that everyone who has made Britain their permanent home should pay full UK tax on all their income and gains. 'It is not fair. It is not just. It holds Britain back. We will stop it. The next Labour government will abolish the non-dom rule,' he said. He was backed by Mr Balls, the shadow chancellor, who told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'We're going to change it, abolish it and it will raise a lot of money.' But it emerged in a January interview Mr Balls said: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' The contradiction was seized on by the Conservatives, who produced an internet graphic showing Mr Balls' two quotes. Mr Keen, a retired GP, posted the image to his Facebook page, adding: 'Can someone explain this to me please, I am now officially confused.' In January shadow chancellor Ed Balls warned: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' A friend suggested he 'ask a certain member of your family I am sure he will give you chapter and verse on it and invite him into the group I am sure we won't abuse him to much'. Mr Keen asked his friends on the site: 'What would you say to my lil cuz if he were on here?' Announcing the policy, Labour aides suggested the change in the rules, which date back to the 18th century, would raise as much as £1billion. But tax advisers immediately disputed this, saying driving non-doms away would in fact cost the Treasury significant sums. With non-doms paying around £8billion in tax and national insurance a year, it is claimed that Labour's proposal could in fact create a huge hole in Treasury coffers. Last year Mr Keen declined to say if he was planning to vote for his cousin. He told the Sunday Times: 'Ed's my cousin and I have known him all my life. That's all I can say. I don't talk about politics on the doorstep.' And he suggested that voters think David Miliband would have made a better Prime Minister. He said: 'The people out there will say David would have made a really good prime minister. That's the general feeling out there. People don't take the piss out of him. They wouldn't dare. People wouldn't take the piss out of Dave.'",Mike Keen revealed he was 'officially confused' in public Facebook post . Ed Miliband vowed to 'abolish' the 200-year-old tax rule for non-doms .

FA chairman Dyke must find £30million to fund his masterplan to reform grassroots football with more 3G pitches in urban coaching hubs, and has identified the non-league national team as an area of potential saving. England C, which has operated under different names since it was formed in 1979, is managed by former Barnet boss Paul Fairclough, who selects from players outside the Football League, aged 23 and under. FA chairman Greg Dyke could axe the England C team to save money to help improve grassroots football . The team normally plays only three or four times a season, but some friendly fixtures have attracted attention inside the organisation because of the elaborate travel involved. England won 6-1 in Bermuda, in June 2013, and won 1-0 in Jordan, in March last year. Fairclough’s team also compete in the International Challenge Trophy, a competition for European semi-pro national teams, but did not qualify for the semi-finals of this year’s tournament from a home-and-away qualifying group featuring Turkey, Slovakia and Estonia. They were beaten by Cyprus U21s in friendly in Larnaca, in February, but there are no more fixtures planned and, since a meeting last week, fears have increased about the long-term future for a team which has been known since its formation as the National Game XI, England Semi-Pro and England Non-League.

On Saturday, I said his battle with Jordan Henderson would be key to the game. There’s no doubt who won that one. Delph was different class. He put in an all-action display and ran the game.

They are the form team down there right now. When you’re in a relegation scrap, nothing boosts your confidence quite like goals. That’s why Leicester have been able to drag themselves off the bottom of the table. They have scored 10 in their last four, including three at Tottenham in a game they were unlucky to lose 4-3. Now they have won three games in a row - a winning streak only Arsenal (8) and Chelsea (4) can beat. They have good pace up front with Jamie Vardy, and Leonardo Ulloa finally found his shooting boots with a goal against Swansea. The key for Leicester now is that, of their six remaining games, four of them are at home. That home advantage could be the difference between staying up or going down. Leonardo Ulloa celebrates with Leicester team-mate Esteban Cambiasso during the Foxes win over Swansea . Que sera, sera . Of course, for sentimental reasons I wanted Steven Gerrard and Liverpool to get to the final. What better way for one of Liverpool’s greatest ever players to depart the club than with an FA Cup win? It is a shame he won’t be there but he has probably achieved more at Liverpool than he would ever have dreamed of. And if there’s anybody who thinks about the team rather than himself, it’s Stevie.

Chelsea just do what's needed . 1 - Chelsea have lost just one of their last 13 Premier League home games against Man Utd (3-2 in Oct 2012), winning eight and drawing four . It's difficult to be critical of a side like Chelsea. They have an incredible record at home and an uncanny ability to win the big games. That’s exactly what happened against Man United on Saturday. People say it was a tactical masterplan to play Kurt Zouma in midfield to stop Marouane Fellaini. I’m not so sure. Yes, Fellaini has been effective in recent weeks but I don’t think we’ve got to the stage where he needs to be man-marked. Chelsea are a good enough team to beat United without resorting to that. But you cannot argue with the results. Chelsea have developed a ruthless, efficient style. Since losing to Spurs on New Year’s Day they are unbeaten in the league. In their last two games they have had three shots on target. Two of them have gone in and they have won both games 1-0. That’s how to grind out a title. The United game was Jose Mourinho’s 102nd clean sheet out of 190 games in the Premier League. He knows exactly what’s needed to bring home the trophies. No wonder Roman Abramovich looked so delighted after the final whistle. Kurt Zouma (right) and Marouane Fellaini battle for the ball during Chelsea's 1-0 victory over Man United .

I’m sure most neutrals wanted to see Arsenal play Liverpool in the FA Cup final, and plenty of Arsenal fans will be happy to see Villa there instead. But they will have to be careful. Against Wigan and Hull last year, and Reading this time around, Arsenal have made hard work of these games. The pressure will be all on them and they will have to compete with the energy of that Villa midfield. It will certainly make for another absorbing final. Arsenal celebrate during the win over Reading but will have to be careful against Villa in the FA Cup final . Burnley must keep believing . April 25 - Leicester (H) May 2 - West Ham (A) May 9 - Hull (A) May 16 - Stoke (H) May 24 - Aston Villa (A) For Sean Dyche and his side, their season starts now. Burnley have been on a poor run and another defeat this weekend has added to their worries. They have only scored one goal in their last seven games, although that was a significant winner against Manchester City. But that is a desperate drought that has seen them sink right to the bottom of the table. Their top scorer Danny Ings has not scored since February though it has been difficult for him — I’m sure he’s got other things on his mind with so much speculation about his future. He has had a decent season but he has suffered from a lack of support and that is a problem. Burnley's top scorer Danny Ings has not scored since February and has not suffered from a lack of support . Only two other Burnley players have scored more than twice all season - George Boyd and Ashley Barnes with five each. It’s hard to see where their next goal is coming from. But for Dyche the fixture list has been kind. Some of their relegation rivals have still got to face the top sides but the highest-placed team Burnley have to face are Stoke in ninth. Dyche and his team only have five games left but there’s no reason why they can’t get something from each one of them. Burnley players look dejected following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Everton and are not bottom of the table . Awards season . 4 - Kane is only the fourth Tottenham player to score 20+ goals in a Premier League season after Gareth Bale, Jurgen Klinsmann and Teddy Sheringham. I have said throughout the second half of the season that the Player of the Year award will be between Eden Hazard and Harry Kane. Diego Costa, Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez have all done well but those two have been consistently excellent. Over the last six games there’s no doubt Hazard’s performances should have that contest wrapped up. He has been nothing short of brilliant in the games that really matter. Kane has been the best thing about Tottenham’s season. He has rescued their front line and I would be amazed if he doesn’t win Young Player of the Year. I prefer watching attacking players doing exciting things and he has done that all season. He came from nowhere and he has been one of the stories of the year.

8611,"An Arizona man who suffers from an extreme case of a tumor disorder in which his body is covered in noncancerous lumps said he finally has a feeling of belonging. Bob Heslip, 50, suffers from Neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF-1, which is caused by a gene malfunction that causes the bubble-like bumps to appear all over his body. However, he says he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life now that he has joined the Venice Beach Freakshow  where he has met performers including a bearded lady and America's smallest couple. 'When I met the performers, there was a feeling of belonging. I felt at home,' Heslip told The Huffington Post. Scroll down for video . Bob Heslip (pictured), 50, who suffers from Neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF-1, has joined the Venice Beach Freakshow and said for the first time in his life he feels comfortable in his skin . The noncancerous lumps began appearing on his body around puberty and became more severe as he aged . Heslip, who works at a Dollar Tree in Tuscon, said around eight months ago he was on vacation with his family in Los Angeles when they saw the Freakshow, as his daughter is a fan of the TV show. Todd Ray, the owner, saw Heslip and recognized his condition as NF-1 and began talking to him. 'I went to the front, took off my shirt and the crowd went crazy,' Heslip told the Huffington Post. He accepted Ray's offer to join the show as the 'Bubble Boy' a few weeks ago and said it gives him the platform to talk about his condition to people who otherwise just stare. For Heslip, the tumors on his body began appearing around puberty but became more severe as he aged. He noted that when he got married 25 years ago he did not have any bumps on his face, but now he does. 'I don't feel a lot of pain from the bumps,' Heslip told The Huffington Post. 'I have a large bump on the side of my body that used to be very sensitive, but not so much now.' To have the tumors surgically removed is not an option for him as he said it is not guaranteed that they will not grow back or possibly grow back larger than before. Heslip said: 'When I met the performers, there was a feeling of belonging. I felt at home' Staying in hiding from the public is also not an option as he has a family including his wife and children to support. Ray said that some people will see Heslip's hands and will not want him to touch their items while he is working because they think he is contagious. As Heslip manages his job in Tuscon and his new role as a performer, he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life because of the Venice Beach Freakshow. The job which he works on the weekends is also making it possible for him to talk to others about NF-1. 'I want to teach people that it's not taboo to ask questions. I'm OK talking about it,' he told the Huffington Post. 'My son and oldest daughter also have this condition and my speaking out about it gets them excited. They know my attitude is positive.' Heslip joins performers including Asia Ray, Morgue, Jessa the Bearded Lady, Larry the Wolf Boy and Miss Sunshine as part of the Venice Beach Freakshow (pictured above) Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders affecting around one in every 3,000 people. NF-1 ranges from mild to severe and can cause more symptoms in some people than in others. The condition primarily affects the skin, the nervous system and the eyes, and most people with NF-1 have recognizable signs before the age of 10. The most common symptoms include six or more light brown skin spots (café au lait spots), freckles in unusual places, such as under the arms and in the groin, colored bumps on the iris (Lisch nodules) and Neurofibromas. Regardless if the NF-1 gene change was inherited from a parent or is newly affected, every person who has an NF-1 gene change has a 50 per cent chance of passing it on every time they have a child. Genetic testing for the NF-1 gene is available and can be coordinated for families in which testing would be appropriate.

5006,"I am not vain, rich or brave enough to face plastic surgery, when my mother rang for her weekly chat and I was feeling ancient after spotting a new wrinkle, I probed her for beauty advice. If I was feeling old, she, with a nearly 40-year-old daughter, must be feeling ancient - yet she looked great. At 65, she could easily pass for ten years younger. Scroll down for video . Sarah's face was transformed after the exercises. She's pictured before (left) and after (right) 'I thank my genes, the fact I've never tried a cigarette and the facial stretches I've been doing for 30 years,' she said. Ah, those. I remember my mum slathered in Vaseline, gurning in a Club Sport tracksuit while I ate my Coco Pops, invariably wearing the Deely Bobbers I insisted on sleeping in between 1983 and 85. So they worked? My mother swore they did. Facial exercises have been around as long as youth has been considered the hallmark of beauty, with some claiming Cleopatra was the first celebrity fan. The first official guide, however, was published in Paris in 1710, outlining the beauty routine of Ninon de L'Enclose, a courtesan famed for her lasting beauty. Nearly two centuries later, Sanford Bennett - a notoriously wrinkle-free San Franciscan 70-year-old - released his book, Exercising In Bed, which gave away his facial secrets. From then on, facial exercisers came thick and fast. Jack LaLanne, the funny Hollywood guy permanently in tight Lycra was the visage visionary of the Fifties, right up to the Eighties. Today, however, the go-to expert is Carole Maggio, the LA-based creator of Facercise, with a celebrity and royalty-packed client list. The Furrow Smoother . This involves spreading my fingers across the centre of my forehead, then pulling my fingertips down while pushing my brows up so I look very confused. I had to hold this tension for 30 seconds while staring at the ceiling. The Furrow Smoother involves spreading the fingers across the centre of the forehead for 30 seconds . Sarah pulls her fingertips down while pushing her brows up to work her forehead muscles . The Lip Lift . This is an exercise which requires a Joker smile that moves up and down an inch using visualisation. 'Imagine a plumber bent over in low-slung Levi's,' Maggio encourages. 'Now move your mouth to express that - ew - and hold it.' Maggio encourages exercises to form an 'ew' expression of disgust and hold it to lift the lips . The Nose Transformer . This isn't pretty either. It requires me to push up the tip of my nose with my index finger while pulling my upper lip down for a count of 40. All of these exercises are performed while looking at myself so I can see that I resemble a tired-looking Miss Piggy with a hangover. But I feel the burn. The burn! The burn that means it's working! The next day, after my first facial workout, I wake up to a face as sore as my glutes were after I took my first spin class in 2004, but I push on with my exercises. The Nose Transformer was so tough that Sarah's face muscles were still and sore the next day . 'After six days of doing her exercises twice a day, I could see significant improvement,' a gorgeous gal pal, also in her 50s, told me. Her nickname is Maggio the Magician and I needed her to work her magic on my ageing face. Luckily, her books and DVDs are available on Amazon and ship within days. Carole's first foolproof tips seem easy enough to do: sleep on your back without any pillows under your neck and try to avoid carbs after 5pm. She also advises drinking more water and eating more protein. These things instantly help everyone's appearance as they get older, apparently. The DVD and guidebook then go through a series of exercises that Carole promises will take the years off and plump up my ageing skin. So. Now my new gym routine is less about getting sweaty in Lycra and more about sitting in front of a mirror pulling a series of scary, exaggerated expressions, working my 57 facial muscles while sitting with my butt clenched and back straight. I work my way through the exercises without any problems - although it hurts more than I thought it would. I am a sit-down-with-a-cheese-sandwich-and-a-Jane-Austen-novel kind of girl rather than a natural gym bunny, but even I'm shocked my face aches this much. I am feeling the desired burn in places I never knew I had. Facial exercising is not for the lazy - it takes about 20 minutes a day and it really does hurt in places - but after two weeks my husband is convinced he can see a difference, and I feel a bit more plumped up; more ruddy farmer's wife than aging, old crone. My upper lip is definitely fuller and for the first time in my life I feel bee-stung enough to try red lipstick. Do I look younger? I'd say so. Fresher? Indeed. Perhaps face exercise really are the key to facing forward? www.facercise.com .","Sarah Ivens, 39, tries the 'furrow smoother', 'lip lift' and 'nose transformer' Exercises prescribed by Carole Maggio, the LA-based creator of Facercise .

11469,"Once in a while, a colossal chunk of ice breaks free from Antarctica's majestic landscape and drifts out into the ocean. In March, Nasa was able to capture this remarkable event from space during a process that was months in the making. The monster iceberg, larger than Manhattan, was spotted breaking away from West Antarctica's Getz Ice Shelf by the U.S. National Ice Center (NIC). Scroll down for video . Last month, Nasa captured a 17 miles (27km) long iceberg being born in the West Antarctica's Getz Ice Shelf. The image on the left shows the landscape before the iceberg broke three and on the right the monster berg floating in the ocean . Glaciers in the Amundsen Sea of west Antarctica are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels. Measuring 17 miles (27km) long, iceberg B-34 appears to have fractured and moved out into in the Amundsen Sea sometime in mid- to late-February 2015, Nasa said. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) on Nasa's Terra and Aqua satellites took images spanning the calving event. B-34 is the 34th iceberg from the 'B' quadrant of Antarctica to be tracked by the NIC. The new berg is still smaller, however, than the much older B-15T- a fragment of B-15 that initially broke off from the Ross Ice Shelf in March 2000. The first image (left) shows the iceberg on February 16, when it was still attached to the ice shelf. By February 28 (middle), it appears to have separated somewhat. By March 5 (right), it is floating freely . B-34 is the 34th iceberg from the 'B' quadrant of Antarctica to be tracked by the NIC. Glaciers in this region are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels . Large icebergs can have large-scale impacts on the Southern Ocean. For example, as the bergs melt, the addition of cold, fresh water to the saltwater ocean can affect ocean currents and circulation. Researchers have shown, however, that even more fresh water comes from the melting of smaller and much more numerous bergs. The Amundsen Sea has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the West Antarctic. A study published in December suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago. Researchers believe that the melting of glaciers in West Antarctica, which contain enough water to raise sea levels by at least a metre, may be irreversible. The findings of the 21-year study by Nasa and the University of California, Irvine claim to provide the most accurate estimates yet of just how fast glaciers are melting in the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Scientists found the rate by taking radar, laser and satellite measurements of the glaciers' mass between 1992 and 2013. They found they lost an average 83 gigatons per year (91.5 billion U.S. tons), or the equivalent of losing the water weight of Mount Everest every two years. Scientists are hoping to combine images such as this with noises recorded from icebergs to detect the different ways that glaciers lose ice into the oceans. Earlier this year, the incredible sounds of an ice 'cracking' and crashing down into water as an iceberg were recorded by researchers.. The scientists used underwater microphones aboard buoys to record a variety of iceberg births at the Hans Glacier in Svalbard, Norway during three days in August 2013. The recordings were then combined with time-lapse photos of the glacier during the same period. By synchronising the sound recordings with the photographs, the researchers discovered that different types of ice loss are associated with distinct rumbles, snaps and splashes. They are interested in this because the ice floating around Antarctica has thinned by nearly 20 percent, according to recent research. This is depleting the bulwark that prevents the permanent collapse of glaciers covering the southern continent. The study, based on satellite measurements between 1994 and 2012 by the European Space Agency, sheds new light on how Antarctic ice responds to climate change. Ice barriers have an average thickness of between 400 to 500 meters (1,300 to 1,600 feet) and can extend hundreds of kilometers off the coast of Antarctica. If the ice becomes too thin it would allow the permanent glaciers to slip into the ocean and start melting, sharply increasing the rise of ocean levels. Researchers found that the total volume of Antarctic ice changed little between 1994 and 2003, but after that point melting markedly accelerated. Ice in western Antarctica declined throughout the study period. A slight increase in ice thickness was observed in eastern Antarctica before 2003 when rapid melting began, leading to an 18 percent reduction of thickness compared to 1994. 'Eighteen percent over the course of 18 years is really a substantial change,' said Fernando Paolo, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego. 'Overall, we show not only the total ice shelf volume is decreasing, but we see an acceleration in the last decade.' If the rate of thinning continues, the ice shelves could lose half of their volume over the next 200 years, the researchers calculated.",Iceberg fractured from Getz Ice Shelf and moved into the Amundsen Sea sometime in mid- to late-February .

She's pictured here with the frame of a kayak she created modelled on her own vagina . Igarashi was first arrested in July, but was freed several days later following a legal appeal and after thousands of people signed a petition demanding her release. But Tokyo police arrested her again in December, on three counts of distributing 'obscene' data -- namely CD-ROMs containing computer code for a 3D printer that would allow users to make copies of the vagina-shaped kayak. She was held in custody for around a month before being granted bail. 'I have been arguing that it is strange to single out one part of a human body that every woman has' and treat it as obscene, she told journalists and supporters after the hearing. 'Some people say my works are cheap and not even art, but that should not justify police moves to arrest me,' she said.

If convicted of distributing or possessing obscene materials for the purpose of selling, Igarashi could face up to two years in jail and/or a fine of as much as 2.5 million yen ($21,000).

5701,"Ryanair passengers travelling to Edinburgh and Zadar, Croatia were delayed for hours after two of the budget airline’s planes clipped wings at Dublin Airport this morning. Photos snapped by travellers show the tip of a winglet dangling by a thread after clipping the other plane - and it's the second time in six months two Ryanair planes have collided at Ireland's busiest airport. Passengers escaped injury when the planes collided as they taxied to a runway shortly before 8am, but the incident caused disruption for hundreds of travellers. Passengers snapped photos of the damaged winglet after two Ryanair planes collided at Dublin Airport . Passengers escaped injury after two Ryanair planes clipped wings while taxiing to a runway at Dublin Airport . Passenger Shannen Murphy, who was seated on the Edinburgh-bound plane which lost part of its winglet, told MailOnline Travel: ‘We were just about to approach the runway and there was another Ryanair plane quite close, but I thought maybe it had broken down or something. ‘And then next of all there was a jerk in the plane, which felt like we had gone over a really big pothole.’ Moments later the pilot announced over the tannoy that there had been ‘an incident’ with another plane and passengers would have to return to the terminal. Shannen said passengers were stuck on the plane for up to 90 minutes, as they waited for buses to arrive, and they arrived in Edinburgh about three hours behind schedule. ‘As soon as we were off [the bus] we were taken straight to a new plane and within 30 minutes we were up in the air.’ One of the Ryanair planes' winglets was left dangling after the collision on a taxiway at Dublin Airport . Emergency services attended the scene of the collision as a precaution. Passengers on board both planes were taken back to the terminal by bus and put on replacement aircraft to continue their journeys to Scotland and Croatia. The Boeing 737s involved in the collision were taken out of service to undergo inspections and any necessary repairs. The collision caused delays for other flights, with one passenger tweeting: '2 jets hit at Dublin, my flight to Malaga delayed'. Dublin Airport said in a tweet: ‘No injuries on the two aircraft which clipped each other on a taxiway this am. Passengers in process of being taken off the aircraft.’ A passenger snapped this photo of the Boeing 737s after they collided while taxiing to a runway . Emergency services attended the scene of the collision as a precaution, but were not needed . Dublin Airport sent a series of tweet urging passengers to check their flight status .

9101,"A girl who believed she had a bad hangover was found to have 13 blood clots in her lungs. Holly Barber, from Manchester, woke up feeling unwell and with chest and neck pains – but chalked it down to heavy drinking a few days before. But when the 25-year-old started coughing up blood she knew it was something serious. She rushed to hospital, where doctors found 13 pulmonary embolisms, blood clots blocking the main artery of her lungs, killing the tissue and stopping her from breathing properly. She was treated with medication but, incredibly, a year later was dealt another blow – when medics found another melon-sized blockage in her right lung. Holly Barber, 25, was horrified to be told she had 13 blood clots in her lungs as she believed  she was suffering was just a bad hangover. She is pictured before (left) and after her diagnosis (right) Ms Barber began coughing up blood and was having difficulty breathing, so rushed to hospital. It was there doctors diagnosed pulmonary embolisms - blood clots that were blocking the arteries in her lungs . She was horrified to be told the blockage was so big she was probably days from death. She now takes blood-thinning medication to prevent future clots, but the shock of the ordeal has led her to completely changed her lifestyle. She has given up drinking and taken up exercise in an effort to lead the healthiest life possible, and wants to encourage other to do the same. Ms Barber, who has set up her own diet business, said: 'I was so scared when I started coughing up blood, I had no idea what was happening to me but I knew it wasn't a hangover. 'I used to love partying with friends but after suffering from 13 blood clots, I knew I needed to change my ways. 'A terrifying experience like this gives you a brand new outlook and makes you appreciate things so much more, I'm lucky to be alive. 'I did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture.' A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. As in Miss Barber's case, it can be life threatening, as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs. A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery, which is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. This blockage – usually a blood clot – is potentially life threatening, as it can prevent blood from reaching the lungs. The symptoms of a pulmonary embolism can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. But the main symptoms include: . chest pain – a sharp, stabbing pain that may be worse when you breathe in . shortness of breath – this can come on suddenly or develop gradually . coughing – this is usually dry, but may include coughing up blood or mucus that contains blood . feeling faint, dizzy or passing out . A person should visit their GP as soon as possible if you have a combination of these symptoms. If  symptoms are particularly severe, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. Source: NHS Choices . The symptoms, feeling dizzy, chest pain, coughing and being short of breath can sometimes be difficult to recognise because they can vary between individuals. Ms Barber first discovered she was battling with pulmonary embolisms in 2012, when she was 22-years-old. She was feeling weak and ill, but had been heavily drinking and partying a few days before, so she presumed it was just a bad hangover. Then she started coughing up blood, struggling to catch her breath and suffering from chest and neck pains so her mother Carol Mack, 54, and stepfather Bob Tomkins, 57, decided to rush her to hospital. A scan revealed she had 13 blood clots in her lungs, though it was found they had not spread from her legs, where clots normally form. Despite many tests, nothing could explain what had caused her pulmonary embolisms. The only possible risk factor was the contraceptive pill, which she stopped taking straightaway. She was put on Heparin injections – which thin the blood - to prevent any blood clots from reoccurring, as well as other drugs to reduce the pain. Ms Barber said: 'I had to inject myself every month and I was on pain relief for some months after suffering from my blood clots. 'I was constantly anxious for a year and I suffered from panic attacks and anxiety.' Because of this anxiety, when she got a similar pain again in May 2013 - almost exactly a year later - she just thought that she was being paranoid and chose to ignore it. Luckily, she eventually forced herself to go back to hospital and a CT scan revealed she had a melon-sized blockage in her right lung. The blood clot has entered the artery of her right lung after passing through the heart, and had blocked the artery, cutting off blood supply so a large part of the lung tissue around it had died. Ms Barber said: 'It was the size of a melon and almost covered my heart, if I had left it any longer I would have died. A year later, Ms Barber was rushed to hospital again, and doctors found a melon-sized blockage in her lungs. She is pictured here with partner Steven, who she lives with in Manchester . Before her illness (left and right), Ms Barber was a 'party girl' and loved to drink. She has now given up drinking in favour of a healthy lifestyle. 'I did like a drink but you have to look at the bigger picture', she said . She will now have to take the warfarin, which stops her blood from clotting, for the rest of her life. The shock of being diagnosed twice has meant she has decided to turn her life around. Some doctors advised she shouldn't exercise because the pulmonary embolisms meant her lungs' ability to pump oxygen around the body was reduced. But she has found safe ways to exercise and plans to run the Great Manchester Run in May to show other sufferers that it is possible. She said: 'I'm so thankful to be alive, I have set up my own healthy lifestyle business called Healthy Fit + which helps others make the right lifestyle choices. 'I have never felt better and I hope my story shows others who have suffered from pulmonary Embolisms that they can achieve their fitness goals.' Ms Barber has been with her boyfriend Steven, who works for a solar panel company, for nearly four years and they now have their own flat in Manchester together. But Ms Barber is uncertain whether her reduced lung capacity will mean she will be able to have children. She said: 'I really want children in the future because I am a maternal person but it would be a high risk pregnancy. Ms Barber has now set up her own diet business, hoping to encourage others to take up healthy habits . 'I would have to be in a good condition, hence my healthy lifestyle now.' Dr Noel Snell, Director of Research at the British Lung Foundation, said: 'A pulmonary embolism - better known as a blood clot in the lungs - causes a blockage in a pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. 'Some blood clots can be life-threatening, for example a large clot in the main artery. 'Sometimes people will get multiple small recurrent blood clots and will notice that they become increasingly breathless and experience chest pains - these can be quite difficult to spot and are often diagnosed late.'

Louise Nesbitt was employed at Perth mining exploration company Dragon Mountain Gold. On January 12 last year, she mistakenly sent a text to her boss meant for her daughter's boyfriend who was engaged as a contact plumber for the firm. A Perth office bookkeeper was fired from her job after she called her boss 'a complete d***' in a text message . In the message, Ms Nesbitt wrote: 'Now remember ... [her employer] Rob is a complete d***... we know this already so please try your best not to tell him that regardless of how much you might feel the need.' Realising her mistake, she immediately texted her boss asking him to delete the message and ignore its contents. Ms Nesbitt sent a further message explaining the insult was a 'joke within our family'. 'I need to explain ... that message came across so wrong,' she said. 'That is not how I feel. My sense of humour is to exaggerate. It is not how I feel. 'Please forget it and just go on as normal. I am very very sorry.' Ms Nesbitt - who had employed at Dragon Mountain Gold since 2004 - was fired five days after the incident, with her employer saying it was due to 'gross misconduct'. She filed a unfair dismissal complaint with the Fair Work Commission. While she cross examined, Ms Nesbitt argued the text had been taken out of context. The commission also heard she had sent an email to her employer expressing the view she did not think he listened to her or took her counsel on board. This had been causing tension between the two before the January 12 incident. Commissioner DJ Cloghan ruled against Ms Nesbitt. 'On the evidence, I am not persuaded that when Ms Nesbitt referred to Mr Gardner as ""a complete d***"", it was her sense of humour to exaggerate or, that it was ""light-hearted insult"" or it should be read in the context of the person it was meant for,' Commissioner DJ Cloghan said.

5628,"Angry parents continued to protest outside a Texas middle school this week after an eighth grade boy who wrote a violent and disturbing story about killing his classmates was allowed to stay in class. The Tidwell Middle School student - aged 13 or 14 - started a blog on a writers website called Wattpad in August last year that was called 'Killing Children', with the tag line: 'This is a continuous story about me murdering people I hate.' There were 11 chapters published online up until  January this year, featuring stories titled 'Massacre', 'Thrown Under The Bus' and 'Blood, Blood, And More Blood'. Some of the names of students at the school featured in the blog, with one section reading: 'He tries to hold in a scream, but it escapes him when I drive the scissors down his body.' Disturbing: The blog, Killing Children, on website Wattpad has been pulled down, but this is the title page for the blog. The 11 stories were given names like 'Massacre' and 'Blood, Blood, And More Blood' Anger: Despite the outrage expressed by parents, the eighth grade boy was allowed to return to school last month, and the District Attorney has confirmed no charges will be laid, saying the stories were 'horror fiction' The children who were named eventually came across the blog and alerted their parents, who reported the incident. The boy was then removed from class, and his parents subsequently withdrew him from the school. The blog was also taken down. However late last month, as students returned from spring break, so did the boy. The Northwest Independent School District confirmed they allowed the eighth grader to return. The district and the boy's parents maintained the blog was a work of fiction, describing it as a horror story. The Tarrant County District Attorney's Office also ruled the  blog was protected by the First Amendment. The decision has caused outrage among parents, who say they are scared for the safety of their children. 'I'm in disbelief. I can't even believe it,' parent Cindy Copeland told NBC DFW. Mrs Copeland has kept her daughter, who is in the 6th grade, out of school for eight days, frightened that something might happen at the school. Mrs Copeland said she read the blog and was disgusted. 'The description of what he will do to these peers and classmates, it's despicable,' she told NBC. 'It's not therapeutic writing. And if it was then it should have been kept private, not broadcast for the entire world to see. 'It's a threat.'

'The fact that I have to have those kinds of conversations with my children on how to my protect themselves against harm from another classmate, it's very disheartening as a parent,' she said. The situation was reported to the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office, who investigated the boy and his writings. An official decision was made this week not to file any charges. In a statement to NBC, the District Attorney said: 'Although the blog in question contains many disturbing, graphic, and offensive descriptions of violence, it does not meet the legal requirements for a charge of criminal or delinquent conduct under Texas law.'

The video, allegedly shot near the capital of Sanaa, sees some 20 men wearing desert camouflage uniforms carry out a carefully choreographed rifle routine in the sand. The 'establishing' of an ISIS-related group in Yemen comes after months of conflict which has seen Iran-backed Houthi rebels fight both the government and the local Al Qaeda affiliates. Scroll down for video . Declaration of fear: The video shows a group of ISIS supporters, calling itself Soldiers of the Caliphate in Yemen, announcing that they have established a 'caliphate' in the country . The group in the video, which calls itself Soldiers of the Caliphate in Yemen, began to emerge late last year and it is believed that their aim is to take over Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which has strongholds in the south and south-east of Yemen. Last month, the ISIS-related group claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks at two mosques in the Houthi-controlled capital of Sanaa. Four bombers wearing explosive belts targeted worshippers in and around the crowded mosques during Friday prayers killing 137 people and wounding 357. Although the location of the video, released on Friday, has yet to be confirmed, it is claimed to have been filmed near the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which was captured by the Houthis last September. The nine-minute clip is similar to propaganda videos released by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, appearing to be shot and edited using professional equipment.

It starts with a masked man in sandals, sticking a black ISIS flag into the ground to 'declare the caliphate'. He announces that the 'soldiers of the Caliphate will cut the throats' of the Shi'ite Houthis, and 'take back the land they have occupied'. It then shows the two dozen men undergoing military training in the desert, and the fighters can be seen holding rifles and a grenade launcher, before firing some of the weapons in the sand. The possibility of ISIS gaining power in Yemen in the country's current state of chaos is particularly dangerous as one of the world's busiest oil shipping lanes is located off its coast. Yemen is currently on the brink of outright civil war, with several sides battling each other since the conflict began last year. Houthi rebels, backed by Shi'ite Iran, began their advance across Yemen by capturing the capital of Sanaa in September, later forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi . into exile. Fighters loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh have been battling alongside the Houthi rebels, with the Houthis, Saleh-loyalists and Hadi-loyalists all battling al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula(AQAP) in the south. Last month, an intervention led by Saudi Arabia was launched with the aim to restore Hadi and . prevent Yemen disintegrating as a state.

516,"(CNN)An internal inquiry by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in 2009 concluded that Reserve Deputy Robert Bates was shown special treatment and that training policies were violated regarding his role with the agency. Bates is the volunteer deputy who fatally shot suspect Eric Harris instead of stunning him with a Taser on April 2. A Harris family lawyer provided documents to CNN from the 2009 inquiry, which also found that supervisors intimidated employees to disregard policies to the benefit of Bates. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has not responded to repeated calls for comment from CNN. An attorney for Bates, Clark O. Brewster, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday that he disputed the findings in the report and maintained that his client had the proper training. Bates, 73, is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the shooting of Harris. He pleaded not guilty. Bates was working as a reserve deputy for the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office on April 2 when he was involved the arrest of Harris in a weapons sting operation. Bates has said he meant to stun Harris with a Taser after the suspect fled from officers but mistakenly shot Harris with a gun instead. Bates has said the shooting was accidental. He has apologized to the Harris family, as has Sheriff Stanley Glanz. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? The attorney for the Harris family said that Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The sheriff's office denied the allegations in the newspaper's report. It also declined a CNN interview to respond to the claims. Over the weekend, one of Bates' attorneys released most of his training documents and said they prove Bates had proper law enforcement training. However, the records were incomplete. Bates' attorney, Brewster, characterized the 2009 memo as something borne out of jealousy by other officers. The allegations made in the report are the result of misunderstandings and misstatements, he said. The memos obtained by CNN show that a ""special investigation"" was launched in July 2009 at the request of then-Undersheriff Brian Edwards. Edwards asked investigators to look at two questions specifically: Was Bates being treated differently than any other reserve deputies, and were any employees pressured by supervisors to aid Bates? The investigation found that some employees felt pressured to sign off on certificates for training that Bates had not completed. Police caught on camera: The good and the bad . On Friday, the Tulsa County district attorney's office said it had received new information -- likely the 2009 memo -- that ""are worthy of further investigation beyond the scope of the manslaughter case."" The DA's office is reaching out to independent law enforcement agencies to investigate further. Contrary to claims by the sheriff's office that Bates had the required training to be in the field, the 2009 memo indicates otherwise. The document names then-Chief Deputy Tim Albin (currently undersheriff) and then-Capt. Tom Huckeby (now a major) as two supervisors who allegedly pressured lower-ranking officers to make exceptions or falsify records for Bates. One deputy reported that he was tasked with providing field training for Bates. The written policy is that a reserve deputy is required to have 480 hours of training, but that Huckeby and Albin pressured the trainer to write that Bates was qualified after only 320 hours. The trainer, fearing reassignment if he did not comply, signed a memo stating that Bates had completed 328 hours of training, and did not elaborate on details of the training. Later, the memo was amended by his superiors to read, in part, that Bates was ""capable of performing the functions of a patrol deputy."" The training deputy said he initialed the changes, even though he didn't think Bates was properly trained. According to the investigation memo, the trainer said that if he was honest, he would have said Bates needed remedial training, and that the reserve deputy was ""not really good at traffic stops or operations."" The internal investigation only turned up 72 hours of documented training. The trainer maintained that he oversaw 328 hours of training, but that the records were sent not to the records office, but instead to Huckeby. Brewster denied the claims made by the trainer, and alleged that trainer lost his job in part because of his conduct during the internal inquiry. Another deputy said that she signed a driving certificate for Bates, even though she believed he had not completed the training. Albin asked the deputy to make the certificate, and she did so without questioning him, according to the investigation. The memo lists other instances where Bates performed operations that he wasn't supposed to, given his stature in the department, but that complaints by other officers were dismissed by supervisors. Those who complained about Bates, according to the memo, were told to leave him alone or to make an exception, citing that he did a lot of good for the county and was close with the top leaders in the agency.",Documents show that officers thought Robert Bates got special treatment .

The cause of controversy came when the 37-year-old interviewed non-identical twins from the UK, Lucy and Maria Aylmer, who have become a sensation around the world due to their opposite skin tones. Introducing the 18-year-olds, Armytage congratulated ginger-haired Lucy on getting 'her dad's fair skin,' saying 'good on her.' Controversy: Sunrise host Samantha Armytage has come under fire for a comment made during a Sunrise broadcast last month . 'The Aylmer twins come from a mixed race family in the UK,' the Seven presenter's introduction began. 'Maria has taken after her half Jamaican mum with dark skin and brown eyes and curly dark hair, but Lucy got her dad's fair skin, good on her, along with straight red hair and blue eyes.' Co-host David 'Kochie' Koch seemed taken aback by the comment, taking a confused glance in the 37-year-old's direction. Armytage and Sunrise vehemently deny the claims of the petition, with a Seven spokesperson telling Daily Mail Australia: 'Regular members of the Sunrise audience or anyone who has seen the clip in full will know that Sam was taking a dig at herself.' 'She frequently jokes about the fair skin that runs in her family and difficult it can be to manage in extreme environments.'

Still, the comment wasn't recieved well by many viewers, who took to social media to express their displeasure and to accuse her of making a 'racist' remark. The Change.com petition, which has since been signed by 186 people, was launched on Monday, and demands that Armytage, producer Michael Pell or a representative from Sunrise apologise for the comment. It was started by Melbournian artist Jay Fifth, 27, who told Daily Mail Australia: 'By Sam and the show not recognising, acknowledging and rectifying the statement, they are telling Australia this is acceptable when it is not.' The 27-year-old, who is himself of mixed descent with a Jamaican mother and a Polish father, added on the site that 'the ""good on her"" comment was inappropriate, extremely offensive and very racist.' Unhappy viewers: A Change.com petition was launched on Monday and demands that Armytage, producer Michael Pell or a representative from Sunrise apologise for the comment. The twins are pictured here in childhood . It's the second comment by Armytage that's raised eyebrows in recent weeks. In an interview with Seven's Hamish McLachlan, Samantha said she can be 'fragile at times' thanks to her grueling schedule, which she described as torturous.

3117,"Diego Simeone is made for England. Though his collapse under the weight of a mere brush with David Beckham’s boot in 1998 saw him characterised as the antithesis of Anglo-Saxon values, he is, in reality, more English than the English. For that night in St Etienne - almost the last time an England team truly thrilled a global audience at the World Cup, even if they did so in defeat – is remembered by Simeone for more than his notorious role in Beckham’s sending off, which left England down to ten men for most of the match. 'That game was the best international match I've played in,' said Simeone, remembering the World Cup knock out match, which Argentina won on penalties after a 2-2 draw. Given that he played 106 times for his country that is some compliment. Diego Simeone is hoping to lead Atletico Madrid to second successive Champions League final . England's David Beckham kicks out at former midfielder midfielder Simeone during the 1998 World Cup . 'I love playing against the English,’ Simeone added. ‘They're so passionate, so aggressive, so committed. They were incredible that night. Alan Shearer and Paul Ince were extraordinary. At times it seemed Shearer was fighting us on his own. You have to remember they played for 70 minutes with 10 men.’ And as Simeone stalked out on to the pitch at the end of the Champions League final last year, in full confrontational mode, seeking out Raphael Varane, who had kicked the ball at the Atletico bench in celebration of Real Madrid’s 4-1 win, it was hard to not to get the image of the warrior footballer out of your head. There is much more to Simeone than that of course. He had come within two minutes of winning that Champions League final on a wage bill which was famously less than QPR’s. Since that defeat, he has exacted his revenge at every turn. Real Madrid were beaten in the Spanish Super Cup over two legs, then knocked out of the Copa del Rey, also over two legs, by Atletico, beaten at the Bernebeu and then, most spectacularly , beaten 4-0 at the Vicente Calderon last February. Beckham looks towards the referee during the World Cup clash between England and Argentina . The former England man was shown a red card for lashing out at Simeone during the knock-out match . Last week the teams drew 0-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final; on Wednesday they resume hostilities at the Bernebeu. Real may be marginal favourites but under Simeone, Atletico have gone from the side that could never beat Real Madrid – they hadn’t won for 14 years against them – to the side that (almost) never loses to them. What is always unclear to outside observers is how the man famed for his confrontations and aggression became one of the most tactically astute coaches in Europe. Of course, he always had leadership qualities and undeniable charisma. In his native Argentina they always assumed he would be a manager, such was his dominance of the national team as a captain. But his early results were very mixed. He looked innovative and the man to watch at Estudiantes, where he was one of the first to use motivational video clips from films to inspire his players. It worked: they chased down Boca Juniors for the league title even if he was, in those days, criticised for being overly focused on attacking players. At River Plate though, it looked as if fighting talk and charisma only got you so far. He finished bottom of the league and had to resign. The Atleti boss confronts Raphael Varane during Real Madrid's 4-1 Champions League final win last year . Simeone speaks to referee Bjorn Kuipers during the showpiece final at the Estadio da Luz . He revived his reputation somewhat at Catania and Racing but when he was given the Atletico job in 2011, it seemed more like the old boys’ network at work – he was an iconic player there in the 1990s – than the result of a meticulous recruitment process scouring the best tactical minds in Europe . Of course, the success has been unrelenting, with a trophy every year: the Europa League in 2012; the Copa Del Rey in 2013, beating Jose Mourinho’s Real in the final; and the extraordinary feat of wining La Liga ahead of Barca and Real last season. This year he is comfortably-placed for another Champions League spot but the title is out of the question. Carlo Ancelotti though is right to be nervous ahead of Wednesday’s quarter final. If there were a team for the big occasion, it is Simeone’s Atletico. The 44-year-old got the better of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho during his side's 3-1 victory at Stamford Bridge . He makes a habit of out-witting Europe’s best minds. It isn’t just Ancelotti who has been his victim. Mourinho, too, back in that 2013 cup final and then again last season, when Atletico stunned Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Having brought the game back to 1-1 and being ahead on away goals, you might have expected Simeon’s side to sit back. But they came out for the second half pressing even harder, pushing forwards whenever they could. In effect, Simone did precisely what the opposition least expected and were rewarded with a 3-1 win. And yet there is something very English about Simeone’s style. It’s not just the frequent use of 4-4-2, the wide men, the directness of their play at time and the physicality - it’s their fighting spirit which characterises them and which might be stamped: ‘Made in England.’ It’s why Simeone so related to Shearer and Ince and their performance in that extraordinary 2-2 draw in St Etienne. Ince, Shearer, Simeone; they’re all cast from the same mould. The Argentine manager is understandably adored by the Atletico faithful despite his team's combative style . The Atletico players circle around Simeone as they prepare for the Champions League clash against Madrid . He’s not about to move, having just signed a new contract with Atletico until 2020 and we may never see him in the Premier League. The problem for Simone is that his English values are no longer fashionable in England. When Manchester City choose a new manager, it will be someone who can help to bring tiki taka football to the club, from academy to the first team, under the direction of Txiki Begiristain. When Arsenal appoint, pretty football rather than fighting spirit are likely to be high up the agenda of the new coach. Manchester United, now establishment, might baulk at a street fighter as manager, though they had one once before and he didn’t do so badly. He would be adored at Liverpool, but it would be another gear change from the Brendan Rodgers style that the club has embraced. Chelsea, too, though falling back on Mourinho, also have had the Barcelona model in mind and are thought to be unimpressed with Simeone. Maybe he has simply made too many enemies over the years. But Simeone is useful antidote to those who think English football’s traditional strengths have no place in the modern game. Perhaps he’s just become too English for the new England . Atletico and Real Madrid drew 0-0 in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final . Simeone is tossed  in the air by his players as they celebrate their Spanish league title last season .","Diego Simeone has worked wonders with La Liga side Atletico Madrid .

7281,"Excrement thrown at the statue of British colonialist Cecil John Rhodes has triggered a wave of protests across South Africa against 'racist' historical figures. Memorials to South Africa's colonial past were defaced by mainly young black protesters as statues of British monarchs Queen Victoria and King George V were splashed with paint in the cities of Port Elizabeth and Durban respectively. Vandals poured paint over Scottish-South African missionary Andrew Murray's statue in the Western Cape. War memorials were also defaced. A bronze rider marking the Anglo-Boer War from 1899 to 1902, was toppled from his horse. Object of anger: This statue of Queen Victoria outside the Port Elizabeth city library in South Africa is among a number of memorials to British colonials that have been vandalised during protests against 'racist' figures . A statue of a British soldier lays on the ground after being broken off its base in Port Elizabeth, South Africa . The defaced statue of British mining magnate and politician, Cecil John Rhodes, is lifted by a crane, from its position at the University of Cape Town (left), while (right) a chair marks the spot on the plinth where the decades old bronze statue stood before it was vandalised . In the latest demonstration, vandals smeared paint the figure of a young Mohandas Gandhi. Standing in the square in downtown Johannesburg named for Mahatma Gandhi, the memorial marks the Indian anti-colonial leader's time in South Africa, where he formulated the principle of passive resistance. The protester, who smudged white paint on Gandhi's cloak, accused him of being racist during his time in the country. Founding fathers of Afrikaner nationalism were also targeted. In Pretoria, the memorial of 19th century Afrikaner leader Paul Kruger was twice daubed with bright green paint, while the statue of Marthinus Pretorius, who founded the capital city, was splashed with reddish brown paint, according to local media reports. The statue of Louis Botha, the president of the South African Union in the early 1900s, was smeared with red and blue paint outside parliament in Cape Town on the same day that the Rhodes sculpture was removed from its perch overlooking the University of Cape Town after weeks of student protest. In the Free State province, a statue of Boer General Jan Fick was splashed with red paint in the town named after him in 1883, Ficksburg. Another statue is cleaned down after being splashed with green paint on Pretoria's Church Square . Security guards (left) walk past a statue of former South African statesman and Afrikaner leader Louis Botha, which has been defaced with red paint outside the South African parliament building in Cape Town . Several people have been arrested and local authorities have spent thousands of dollars cleaning up the statues. The opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, has come out in support of its members who have claimed responsibility for these acts of vandalism. It comes days after white solidarity groups held protests over the removal of a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes from the University of Cape Town after it was daubed with excrement. Members of the university council ordered that the bronze sculpture be removed after hearing its presence made black students feel uncomfortable and was seen a symbol of historical white oppression. The defaced statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes is tied by straps to a crane before its removal at the University of Cape Town. It follows weeks of protests at the university over the symbolism of the statue . The monument has been vandalised in recent weeks. It has not yet been decided where it will be moved . The government backed the move, with Sandile Memela, the spokesman for the arts and culture ministry, saying they are working to see if the country can take an 'official position' on statues and other colonial symbols. 'It marks a significant... shift where the country deals with its ugly past in a positive and constructive way', he said to press agency AFP, adding the government did not encourage the violent removal of statues. But the decision to move the monument of Rhodes – a 19th century imperialist who critics say helped pave the way for apartheid – has sparked protests in itself. The youth wing of white Afrikaner solidarity group AfriForum handed a memorandum to parliament in Cape Town to 'demand protection' for their heritage. The same statue was covered in plastic bags after protests by students and staff at the university in March . The university's council heard that black students felt uncomfortable because of the bronze monument . Politician and businessman Cecil Rhodes is called a 'racist' by his opponents. Born in 1853, he made his fortune in diamond mines, and entered into politics as an outspoken supporter of colonialism. He later founded Rhodesia - modern-day Zimbabwe - which was named after him. He believed England was the 'master race', and wanted to draw a 'red line' railway from Cairo to Cape Town for the British Empire - spanning the entire continent of Africa. While his supporters say he brought political and physical infrastructure to South Africa, others say his actions laid the groundwork for apartheid by restricting the rights of black Africans to work. While they are not recognised as supporters of Rhodes, statues of their heroes have been attacked during the university protests. A monument of former president Paul Kruger was splattered with paint, and Afrikaner men, some of them in quasi-military outfits, demonstrated next to it on Wednesday. 'The Afrikaner is -- from a historical perspective -- increasingly being portrayed as criminals and land thieves,' solidary group Afriforum said in a statement. 'If the heritage of the Afrikaner is not important to Government, our youth members will preserve our own heritage.' It has not been decided where the statue of Rhodes will end up, although it will likely be held in a museum. But as tension grow on campuses about the statues of historical South African figures, Jonathan Jansen – the first black vice-chancellor of the University of the Free State – denied that there was a race war coming. He wrote in South African newspaper The Times on Thursday: 'The reason is simple: the overwhelming majority of South Africans, black and white, believe in a middle path somewhere between reconciliation and social justice.'

5389,"A married couple who thought they would never be able to have children are celebrating after welcoming triplets - born three years apart thanks to IVF. Denise and Glen Higgs, from Braunton, Devon, had all but lost hope that they would ever be able to conceive after Glen was made infertile due to cancer treatment. But using his frozen sperm, doctors successfully created eight embryos through IVF fertility treatment and the couple had a daughter Mazy, born three years ago. Louise and Glen Higgs with daughter Mazy, aged three and newborns Carson Alan (left) and Carter Joel (right) The couple tried again using the same batch and Denise gave birth to twins Carter and Carson last week. Former RAF fireman Glen said: 'Medical staff have told us our three children are triplets as they are all from the batch of embryos that were created at the same time. 'It is crazy really - seeing as there are three-and-half years between them in age.' Glen, 35, had always wanted to have children and decided to store sperm shortly before his testicular cancer treatment at the age of 20 made him infertile. He met Dee and, after living together for five years, tied the knot in 2011 before embarking on a course of IVF treatment. Carter Joel Higgs (white top) and Carson Alan Higgs (blue top) who were born on March 24 2015 weighing 5lb 12oz and 5lb 5oz, with IVF triplet sister Mazy Linda Higgs, aged three . Glen said: 'I had an unusual tumour growing within the testicle. After all my treatment, they tested my sperm and they were non-swimmers. 'I knew then that if I ever wanted to have children I would have to go through IVF. 'I had always wanted kids and first went through the process with Dee in 2010. We got funding for the first try and got lucky when Mazy was born.' Glen, now a manager at a filter-making factory, said: 'We then just had to wait and see if it attaches okay. We ended up having eight embryos. 'We put two in to attempt to have a child the first time and froze the other six. 'We were talking about getting rid of them - as we were paying a yearly storage fee - but decided to try again. We had to fund it ourselves this time and put two in again. 'Amazingly they both stuck and we have ended up with two more beautiful babies. 'I always wanted to have kids and am a big family man. The process we went through was hard but we could not have asked more from the final outcome. 'I am the happiest man ever. I have three healthy kids when I thought I would never have any. One we thought would be amazing - to have three is an unbelievable gift. 'What my wife and her body had to go through makes her the real hero to me.'

Care assistant Denise, 27, said: 'When I heard I was having twins I cried and my husband just went white. To now have triplets is simply amazing. In the UK, one in every three thousand births is to triplets. Approximately 15 per cent of 'multiples' are born thanks to IVF. Source: TwinsUK . 'We were so happy though. It has been a huge change in our lives but we have just learnt to adapt. 'Going through IVF is one of the hardest things you ever have to go through as a woman. 'The whole process is horrendous, but as we have proved it does actually work. 'There are so many injections and medication and it can be very undignified at times.

11379,"Leaks from the investigation into shamed newsman Brian Williams were given to the press to pressure him into resignation, a report claims. News broke this weekend that the committee investigating the NBC star found he lied in his reporting to make himself look good at least 11 times. The leaked information, along a report that Williams lied during an interview on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, is designed to make the disgraced anchor negotiate an exit from his network, according to  media executives. Scroll down for video . Leaked: Media executives who spoke to POLITICO say that information given to the press from the NBC investigation into anchor Brian Williams (above) was designed to make the broadcaster resign . Iraq shame: Williams fell from grace after veterans called him out after he lied about being on board a US military chopper which was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, but miraculously managed to land . Investigative journalists at the network have been poring over Williams's past reports and statements after he was booted from the top job in TV news, hunting down signs of dishonesty. Williams was publicly suspended with no pay for six months after it emerged that he repeatedly told a self-aggrandizing, false story about being aboard a military helicopter hit by an RPG over Iraq. The anchor has up to a $50million contract and POLITICO claims that he is being pressured to resign. The site reported that he could receive up to $30million in an exit agreement with NBC. 'You’re dead. Now negotiate,' one media executive told the website. Williams signed a deal with the network last year to continue at the network thought to be worth $10million a year, and he is thought to be looking at a minimum of $20million if he leaves. The eleven incidents cited in media reports about the secretive investigation would mean the trail of deceit from the fallen face of NBC's Nightly News goes far deeper than previously reported. Further scrutiny of Williams's record turned up other questionable claims, including dodging rocket fire over Israel and seeing a body floating through the French Quarter of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Even more such claims have been turned up now, according to reports by CNN and the Washington Post. Both cite a briefing given to NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke on Thursday in New York City at which top executives were updated on the investigation into their flagship news anchor's reporting. Egyptian experience: The latest specific Williams tall tale to emerge dates to 2011 in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Williams said he stared into the eyes of mounted regime soldiers during a violent protest . Tall tales: Information leaked from an NBC investigation points to 11 incidents where Williams lied about his reporting. Above, the anchor appears on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart (right) CNN said 10 claims had been found, while the Post said the figure was 11. An earlier report in the New York Times identified a particular incident, dating back to Williams' coverage of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. NBC investigators honed in on a February 2011 Daily Show appearance where Williams boasted that he had looked into the eyes of mounted Egyptian soldiers in Cairo's Tahrir Square, and seen armed men beat protesters. From his conversation with host Jon Stewart, Williams implies he was in the thick of the chaotic pro-democracy movement down on the ground. However, the Times said, NBC news broadcasts from the time only show that he was on a balcony overlooking the square from a safe distance during violent stretches. Close to the wind: Another questionable Williams claim comes from Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah. Williams said rockets flew 'just underneath' a helicopter he was on when they seem to have gone nowhere near it . Williams is currently halfway through his six-month suspension from his roles as anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News. He was replaced by Lester Holt, who has kept ratings relatively steady. It is unclear whether NBC will put Williams back in the top slot when the suspension ends, or look for a way to get rid of him. Williams has reportedly been banned from speaking publicly about the investigation, or defending himself against any new claims. Industry analysts have said the NBC report is likely to prove significant as the network wrangles over what to ultimately do with Williams, whose contract kept him anchoring the Nightly News through 2019. The findings could play a part in any legal discussions, it was suggested, with NBC gaining leverage over its employee by either agreeing to keep it under wraps or threatening to go public.

Fun times: Lauren is pictured in the hospital on St. Patrick's Day where she seemed to be in good spirits . 'You're supposed to make the best of every moment, but it's hard. It's really, really hard,' Lauren told a WCPO crew that helped set up her interview. Lauren fails to give up in spite of her condition. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 — a date that matches Hill's uniform number — but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.'

7241,"Andrew Sadek's body was found in a river with a bullet to the head nearly two months after going missing in may 2014 . Nearly a year after North Dakota college student Andrew Sadek's body was found in a river with a bullet in the head, his mother still struggles with how her shy son who liked to bowl and belonged to a club of electricity enthusiasts got mixed up in the dangerous world of illegal drugs. Tammy Sadek believes the answer is that her 20-year-old son signed his own death warrant when he agreed to become a confidential informant for police after they caught him selling marijuana. Authorities say he knew what he was getting into and agreed to help them of his own free will. Still, people who knew Sadek are shocked by what happened. 'He was a gentle soul,' said Kristi Brandt, principal of Valley City High School, from which Sadek graduated. Investigators haven't concluded whether Sadek was slain or killed himself. Adding to the mystery, a gun that fires the same caliber bullet that killed Sadek is missing from their family farm near the tiny town of Rogers. An autopsy concluded that Sadek died of the gunshot wound, and that he had no drugs or alcohol in his system. How his body ended up in the Red River has not been explained and no gun was found. An investigative report from two-and-half months ago said the drug task force which recruited Sadek acted appropriately. But his death is raising questions about the use of young, low-level drug offenders as confidential informants and if they should they be given more detailed information about the dangers. Sadek had been working with a drug task force as a confidential informant after he was caught selling marijuana on campus in 2013.  His mother, Tammy Sadek believes that he signed his death warrant when he began working for the force . The circumstances surrounding the death of Sadek, who was a second-year student at the State College of Science, still remain unknown . American Civil Liberties Union spokeswoman Jennifer Cook said informants are doing a dangerous part of law enforcement, without the training. 'The safety risks associated with informant use can far outweigh the benefits,' she said. Sadek was a second-year electrical technician student at the State College of Science, a two-year community college in the southeastern North Dakota city of Wahpeton where about 3,600 students study everything from diesel technology to performing arts. He enjoyed lake activities and golfing in addition to bowling and electrical work while growing up on the family farm. Brandt said Sadek was never a troublemaker in high school, and was always polite and respectful of authority. She doubted his nature changed much in college. 'Sometimes there are changes, but usually it's more on the level of a maturity change, not necessarily a personality change,' she said. He wanted an electrical technician master's degree, but his plans began to go awry in April 2013 when he twice sold marijuana to a confidential informant. Both transactions were small - for a total of $80 worth of drugs - but they took place on campus, making them serious felonies. In November 2013, agents with the Southeast Multi-County Agency Drug Task Force searched Sadek's dorm room and said they found a grinder containing marijuana residue. Though investigators have not found the weapon or made arrests in Sadek's death, his mother Tammy believes he would not have killed himself . The next day, Sadek - facing the prospect of drug charges that could land him in prison for 41 years - completed paperwork to become a confidential informant. The attraction of cooperating with authorities is that it offers the chance to keep a felony off the record of a young person, said Wahpeton Police Chief Scott Thorsteinson. Richland County Deputy Sheriff Jason Weber, now the interim task force supervisor, won't say whether Sadek was specifically told of the dangerous nature of the work he would be doing. The document that Sadek signed to become a confidential informant did not explicitly state the potential risks. Drug investigators need to be more explicit about those dangers, said Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project. 'You have to really say, ""This is the risk: You're entering a world that's dangerous, and you might end up dead,""' Harrington said. Sadek bought drugs three times for the regional task force over the next three months, one short of the four purchases required of him. Officials have said that confidential drug informants, who are often young and low-level drug offenders, need to be more educated of the dangers that come with the job . A security camera videotaped Sadek leaving his dormitory early on May 1, 2014. He wasn't seen again. His body was found in the river about two months later. Authorities estimate that he had died two days after he disappeared. Officials with the North and South Dakota state crime bureaus and a Cass County sheriff's detective reviewed the task force's involvement with Sadek and said in their late January report that they 'did not see anything that caused concern.' 'That's how drug task forces work all over the world,' said Weber, the task force supervisor. 'You're always constantly trying to find the bigger person and go to that person's supplier.' But Tammy Sadek believes that even though the probe was billed as independent, members of the law enforcement community 'have each other's back'. She has a point, according to John Burton, a California attorney and vice president of the National Police Accountability Project. Colleges have faced scrutiny for allowing police to use students as confidential informants, while Sadek's mother has questioned whether officers pressured her son . 'It's just a charade when they do these things,' Burton said of law enforcement agencies investigating one another. U.S. Justice Department guidelines state that authorities should consider the risk of harm to a potential l informant, but do not say that the person should be informed of the risks. North Dakota Attorney General's Office spokeswoman Liz Brocker declined to comment on any policies or procedures that might be in place for drug task forces in the state. Los Angeles-based Loyola Law School professor Alexandra Natapoff said the use of criminal informants 'is almost entirely unregulated' across the country, though that is beginning to change. The Florida Legislature in 2009 passed 'Rachel's Law,' requiring police to adopt policies to protect informants, after 23-year-old Rachel Hoffman was shot to death in 2008 while working as an informant. That law is 'only the beginning of the protections that we need for young, vulnerable informants,' Natapoff said. Tammy Sadek believes her son was scared into becoming a confidential informant. She's started a Justice for Andrew Sadek Facebook page that has more than 3,200 likes. 'I would like to see (task forces) stop using kids,' she said. 'I know it's common, but these are just little fish.'","Andrew Sadek, 20, was working for a narcotics task force after being caught dealing small amounts of marijuana, according to a report .

235,"(CNN)Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are ""conscientious objectors,"" and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new ""no jab, no pay"" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. ""The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments,"" said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. ""It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations. In response to the announcement, more than 7,000 people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms.","Australia to cut welfare benefits for parents who refuse to vaccinate their children .

9072,"The parents of a Slovakian model accused of murdering her British millionaire ex-boyfriend are being forced to sell their house to pay her legal bills. Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain. The blonde model had gone on the run but was eventually tracked down to her family's home 2,000 miles away in the small western Slovakian town of Nova Basoca after police put out an international arrest warrant. Scroll down for video . The Slovakian model had gone on the run after Bush was found shot to death in his rented holiday villa on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain . Maria Kukucova, 25, was arrested in April last year after former partner Andy Bush was found murdered . Now her parents Lubomir Kukuca, 50, and Danka Kukucova, 51, said they feel hated in their own village and are selling up their home to move somewhere more secluded and pay thousands for lawyers' fees in Spain where their daughter is awaiting trial. Gold dealer Mr Bush, 48, from Bristol was found dead in a pool of blood at his five-bed rented home near Estepona just after 3am. His new girlfriend, Russian student Maria Korotaeva, 20, told detectives his Slovakian ex was waiting for them in her pyjamas inside Mr Bush’s mansion when they arrived for a long weekend from the UK. Miss Korotaeva has accused Miss Kukucova of Mr Bush's murder, saying 'She done it. God will be her judge' Maria Korotaeva, 20 (left and right), the most recent girlfriend of murdered millionaire Andrew Bush, 48 (left), has told how the pair arrived at Mr Bush's Spanish villa to find ex-girlfriend Kukucova waiting . She took refuge in Mr Bush’s Hummer while he argued inside with the alleged killer. Miss Korotaeva said Kukucova was ‘crazy’ with jealousy after Mr Bush ended their relationship. She said gunshots rang out before the Slovakian fled the house and forced her out of the car to make her escape. Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested  in Nove Mesto nad Vahom in her home country - more than 2,000 miles from Spain. She was extradited back to Spain in May after handing herself in and locked up in  the maximum security Alhaurin de la Torre jail near Malaga. Maria's parents have visited their daughter and hired lawyers, but their efforts have landed them in debt. Now Kukucova's parents are being forced to sell their home (pictured) in Nova Basoca, western Slovakia, to pay thousands for their daughter's lawyers' fees . Danka Kukucova, 51, (left) Lubomir Kukuca, 50, (right) said said they feel hated in their own village after news of the murder spread and were planning to move to a more secluded area . Her father Lubomir Kukuca, who is seriously ill with cancer, admitted his daughter kept in touch with them while she was on the run. Miss Kukucova’s mother Danka, who supports the family as a manager for a local building society, said at the time of her arrest: ‘We are really struggling. We are upset with what is being said about our daughter.’ Having spent their savings and borrowed money from family, they have decided to sell their home in Nova Bosaca which is on the market for the equivalent of £73,000. One of Maria's cousins, Katarina, who did not want to give her surname, confirmed to the Slovak national newspaper Novy Cas: 'They have decided to leave the house in which they have been living for several years. Mayka Marica Kukucova, pictured after giving herself up to police in her home town of Nova Bosaca in Slovakia . Ms Kukucova had given herself up in her home town which is 3,102km (1,928 miles) from the crime scene in Spain . 'They feel in any case that everybody in the village looks at them as if they are murderers and they no longer feel welcome. People do not ask anything, they just gossip. The parents are fed up with everything. 'The price will not be lower than 100,000 EUR. They will not sell the house for less because they need to return the money that they have borrowed. 'They would also like to buy small secluded house so that they will not be nagged by anybody. 'They are also selling because they hope that Maria will come back and she will want to be in some calm and peaceful place far from people.' Slovak estate agent Lubomir Batovec reckoned the two storey house was not worth more than £59,000 because of the location and its distance from the town of Nove Mesto nad Vahom. He said: 'I am sure that it will not be easy to sell this house - at least not for that money.'

4330,"The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wants dog owners to pick up their pets' droppings and use bins provided (pictured) A London council is to  introduce CSI-style DNA testing for dogs so it can track and fine owners who don't clean up after their animals. The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wants dog owners to submit a DNA sample from the inside of the animal's cheek so it is registered on a database. The council would then use stored information to match the animal responsible with any errant mess found on the streets - and issue the owner an £80 fine. The laboratory testing is believed to be 99.9 per cent accurate. The council hopes that the collection of DNA samples would fit well with new national laws requiring all owners in Britain to microchip their dogs by April next year. And while it will mean an expense for the council, they believe it will represent value for money for residents as similar schemes in the US have reduced dog fouling by up to 90 per cent. The move is part of efforts from the council to reduce its £2.3million annual street cleansing bill. Although the methods may seem extreme, Council leader Councillor Darren Rodwell claims they are necessary to clean up the borough. He said: 'We are the first Council in the country to get really tough on dog mess and pet owners who do not act in a socially responsible way. 'The vast majority of dog owners in Barking and Dagenham are socially responsible but unfortunately a selfish few think it's ok to not clean up after their pet. 'Dog mess not only spoils our streets – it's also a health hazard and especially to young children which is why we are using this innovative approach.' The scheme is currently being discussed under the tagline Leading A New Way - but there are no plans as yet to make it mandatory. The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, Civic Centre pictured, will become the first in the UK to introduce the plans which will allow them to match dog mess to owners and issue fines . They're currently in discussion with stakeholders including the Kennel Club, Keep Britain Tidy and Streetkleen, the company which will run the DNA testing, on how owners can be encouraged to submit the samples. Streetkleen managing director Gary Downie said: 'I believe the combination of DNA testing and enforcement could be the most effective means of ensuring owners are held accountable for their dog's actions. 'In the US, we have experienced reductions in dog fouling by as much as 90 per cent after introducing the programme. 'For the vast majority of responsible dog owners this should pose no problem at all. 'In fact, we believe that the minimal cost involved in the DNA testing will pose value for money when the selfish minority of dog owners are brought to task.'",Barking and Dagenham to become first council to DNA test dog mess .

3246,"Paul Scholes has criticised Mario Mandzukic for over reacting after the Atletico Madrid striker appeared to be punched and bitten by Real Madrid's Daniel Carvajal. Mandzukic was the centre of attention in on-pitch scraps with Sergio Ramos, Raphael Varane and Carvajal during the Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Vicente Calderon.

Ironically Mandzukic was booked for a foul on Varane when it looked like he had been elbowed again, shortly after he needed treatment to stem the blood flow from above his eye after a clash with Ramos. Carvajal, meanwhile, denied that he had bitten Mandzukic. He said: 'I've seen that after the game I have been accused of biting another player, I want to say clearly that I haven't bitten anybody, nor attempted to do so.' The Madrid derby saw Real control the first half before the scrappy second period was dominated by Mandzukic's battles off the ball.

Atletico have to thank their keeper for keeping them in it. 'The second half was poor and not a lot of chances were created. Real will be disappointed because how well they played in the first half, they missed a couple of chances and they could regret it.'

2767,"Swansea manager Garry Monk believes a strong finish will put a different slant on Everton's season - but he is determined to stop his former manager Roberto Martinez profiting at his old Liberty Stadium stomping ground on Saturday. Martinez was lauded by Everton fans last season as the club qualified for Europe with a fifth-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League. But the going has been a lot tougher for the Spaniard in his second season on Merseyside with Everton having only removed the spectre of relegation by winning their last three matches. Garry Monk wants Swansea to continue their own impressive form with victory over Everton on Saturday . Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) scored twice for Swansea in their 3-1 victory over Hull last weekend . Ki Sung-Yueng (second right) also got on the scoresheet as Swansea maintained their impressive form . Vandals even defaced the outside of Goodison Park with 'Martinez Out' and 'Not Good Enough' sprayed on the wall of a stand in white paint, but Monk insists that is simply a part of modern-day football when results do not go your way. 'I always say you're only a few games away from being great or rubbish,' Monk said. 'Roberto is a good manager, but sometimes you have good periods and sometimes you have bad ones. 'It's just making sure you come through them and he's won the last three games, they're back on the up and he'll want to finish the season strongly. 'Of course they'd want to be pushing further up the league and it's not a position you'd associate with Everton. 'But if they can get back up to finish positively it will put a different twist on the season.' Everton have had to balance their domestic commitments with a demanding Europa League campaign which saw them knocked out at the round-of-16 stage last month. And Monk knows from Swansea being in the competition last season how much that has an impact on Premier League performances and results. 'Europe is tough, the travelling and constant games in certain periods,' Monk said. 'It all adds up and the intensity of the football at this level takes it out of you and takes its toll. 'Whether it (Everton's results) is all down to that I don't know, but it does play a major part and if you look at the teams who have played in the Europa League, including ourselves, it has had an impact.' Swansea have never beaten Everton in the league but they claimed a point at Goodison Park in November after being reduced to 10 men following Jonjo Shelvey's dismissal. Martinez criticised Swansea's 'strange' tactics and style of play that day but Monk put it down to 'more frustration with his own side and not winning the game'. Roberto Martinez is hoping to continue Everton's form against his former team in the Premier League . Monk (right) holds no ill feeling towards Martinez, despite him criticising Swansea after defeat in November . 'It might have been a game they'd targeted to win and when it doesn't happen as a manager you do get frustrated,' said Monk, who knows victory will take Swansea past their previous best Premier League points total of 47. 'That's what it boiled down to. But we did well, we had Jonjo sent off so we were never going to go gung-ho and we got a good point.

2947,"The lawyers for a female Pennsylvania police officer charged with criminal homicide last month are trying to keep a video of her fatally shooting an unarmed motorist in the back out of the courtroom. Footage of Hummelstown police Officer Lisa Mearkle shooting two bullets into David Kassick's back as he lay face down on February 2 that was recorded by her stun gun has not been made public. Her attorneys asked a judge on Friday to bar the distinct attorney from releasing the video. Scroll down for video . Pennslyvania police Officer Lisa Mearkle is charged with criminal homicide in the shooting of David Kassick . Kassick, 59, was shot in the back while he lay face down on the ground on February 2. He was unarmed . Mearkle, 36, claimed she shot Kassick in self-defense because she saw him reach into his jacket for a weapon . A preliminary hearing to determine if there is enough evidence to send the case to trial is scheduled for Monday, CBS News reported. A lawyer working for Kassick's family who has seen the video, Christopher Slusser, said it 'leaves nothing to the imagination'. Mearkle is free on bail and suspended without pay . He said: 'Whether she would have been charged or not had the video not existed, I can't answer that,' 'But I can tell you having that video, for me - I won't speak for the DA - but it made it very clear the DA had very little choice not to charge her.' Mearkle, who is free on bail but is under electronic monitoring, is suspended without pay. Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico previously called the video the strongest evidence in the case when Mearkle was charged at the end of March. The stun gun's camera started recording when Mearkle, 36, used it on Kassick, 59, after she tried to pull him over for expired inspection and emissions stickers. Kassick sped away but she caught up to him after he got out and ran. Marsico said Kassick was trying to remove stun gun probes from his back when he was shot. Mearkle's lawyer, Brian Perry, said his client fired at Kassick in self-defense because she thought he was reaching for a gun. She performed CPR after the shooting. Kassick's family said he had struggles with drug addition but that he was not a violent person. A syringe was found near Kassick's body and he had alcohol and unspecified drugs in his system when he died. He was a construction worker. Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Mrisco (left) called video of the shooting the best evidence in the case . The offense of criminal homicide encompasses charges from misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter to murder . According to the arrest affidavit: 'At the time Officer Mearkle fires both rounds from her pistol, the video clearly depicts Kassick lying on the snow-covered lawn with his face toward the ground. 'Furthermore, at the time the rounds are fired nothing can be seen in either of Kassick's hands, nor does he point or direct anything toward Officer Mearkle.' Marsico planned to show the video on Monday, but Mearkle may waive the hearing. The motion filed by her defense team about the video is scheduled to be addressed on Tuesday. The offense of criminal homicide encompasses a range of charges, from misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter to felony first-degree murder. Prosecutors often narrow the charge later in the process, about the time when defendants are formally arraigned.","Pennsylvania police officer Lisa Mearkle charged with criminal homicide .

7669,"They gave us sanitation, wine, aqueducts and roads, but it seems the Romans also gave us one more addition to the list - tuberculosis. Researchers have isolated bacterial DNA of several strains of the disease from the bodies of mummies found in the crypt of a church in the city of Vác in Hungary. They found 14 different strains of TB bacteria that had infected eight of the bodies in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source. Mummified remains of 28-year-old Terézia Hausmann (above) found in the 18th century crypt of the Dominican church in Vác, Hungary, were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers . They say the strains of TB they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late Roman period. Professor Mark Pallen, a geneticist at Warwick University who led the work, said: 'By showing that historical strains can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineages, we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that has ravaged the heart of Europe since prehistoric times.' Historians have long taught that Native American populations were almost wiped out by diseases such as tuberculosis, brought to the New World by European explorers. But a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame. Scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to South America where it spread - long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. While estimates vary, it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the Americas before the Europeans arrived were killed by ‘new’ diseases carried by explorers. Anthropological geneticists Anne Stone of Arizona State University and Johannes Krause of the University of Tubingen in Germany have studied pre-Columbian Mycobacterial tuberculosis genomes. The team examined TB DNA from 1,000-year-old skeletons found in Peru as well as other samples and compared them to modern genomes. They found a clear relationship to TB lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications, used samples taken from the mummified remains of 26 people who had been buried in a cyrpt of Vác's Dominican church during the 18th century. Workers attempting to restore the church stumbled on the remains of nearly 200 people in the crypt in 1994. The bodies had become naturally mummified in the exceptionally dry air. The bodies, many of whom had been wealthy Catholics, had been placed in the crypt fully clothed and in coffins between 1731 and 1838. Walled up and forgotten for about 150 years, the coffins were discovered when a construction worker tapped on a wall during renovation work. Part of the wall gave way to reveal coffins decotrated with skulls and stacked from floor to ceiling. The researchers found that eight of the 26 bodies they examined showed signs that they had died of tuberculosis, five of whom had suffered from multiple strains. It is the first evidence that mixed infections of multiple strains of TB were common in the 18th Century. The researchers found that all of the strains belonged to a lineage of Tuberculosis bacteria known as Lineage 4, which still causes more than a million TB cases a year in Europe and America. By analysing the DNA from these bacteria, the researchers were able to trace back the evolutionary history of the different strains they found by looking for genetic changes that had occurred. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The researchers found several different . The mummies were discovered during restoration work at the Dominican church in Vác, Hungary (above) They found that they all seemed to stem from a single strain of tuberculosis that was in existence between 396CE-470CE. The Roman dating supports recent scientific estimates that tuberculosis first emerged about 6,000 years ago, although some have suggested the disease is tens of thousands of years old. Writing in the journal, the researchers said: 'Phylogenetic dating places the most recent common ancestor of this lineage in the late Roman period. 'Our dating is consistent with evidence that a strain containing the pks15/1 deletion was present in Britain by the second–fourth centuries CE.' The findings also suggest that at the time when the mummies died, TB was already raging in Europe and killing large numbers of people even before urbanisation and crowded housing created devastating epidemics. The dry climate in the crypt preserved the bodies and clothing of the people placed there in the 18th century . The church where the mummies were found is in Vác in the Pest region of northern Hungary (shown above) Professor Pallen, who conducted the work along with researchers at the University Birmingham, University College London, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest, said: 'Microbiological analysis of samples from contemporary TB patients usually report a single strain of tuberculosis per patient. 'By contrast, five of the eight bodies in our study yielded more than one type of tuberculosis - remarkably, from one individual, we obtained evidence of three distinct strains.' Dr Gemma Kay, the first author of the study, added that their analysis had revealed some of the tragic toll the disease was having at the time. She said: 'Poignantly, we found evidence of an intimate link between strains from in a middle-aged mother and her grown-up daughter, suggesting both family members died from this devastating infection.'",More than 200 mummified bodies were found in a hidden crypt of the Dominican church in the city of Vác in Hungary during restoration work . Geneticists led by scientists at the University of Warwick studied samples from 26 of the bodies and found that eight of them had died of tuberculosis .

3207,"Attention is already turning to next season at Liverpool after their FA Cup semi-final exit at the hands of Aston Villa. Unless one of the top four falter dramatically in the final six Premier League games of the season, Liverpool will also miss out on Champions League qualification after only a season back in Europe's elite club competition. Brendan Rodgers undoubtedly needs to reinforce his squad, and Sportsmail assesses Liverpool's chances of landing five of their main targets. DANNY INGS, BURNLEY . Danny Ings has impressed at Burnley this season and is set to leave Turf Moor when his contract expires . Mario Balotelli (left) and Rickie Lambert appear set to depart Liverpool at the end of the season . Liverpool have made their play for Ings but his concern has always been that he gets a fair chance of making a starting place his own. The Reds will look to shed Borini, Lambert and Balotelli but Divock Origi arrives from Lille in June too. Manchester United, Manchester City and Real Sociedad remain in the frame for Ings. COST:  £4million compensation fee . JAMES MILNER, MANCHESTER CITY . Has been a little upset by all accounts that his move to Liverpool was reported almost as a done deal. James Milner appears set to depart Manchester City at the end of the season when his contract expires . Milner (right) is also a target for Arsenal and Everton, as well as Serie A sides Roma and Inter Milan . Wants to see what City discuss first and it is all about how many games he plays.

Liverpool have been frustrated in their pursuit of Norberto Neto from Fiorentina, who is destined for Juventus. Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech (right) appears likely to depart Stamford Bridge before next season . Cech could be out of reach for Liverpool if Paris Saint-Germain make a move for the goalkeeper . They want Cech but don't have the budget to compete with Paris Saint-Germain, who are confident of signing the experienced Chelsea goalkeeper this summer ahead of Arsenal. COST: £10million . ASIER ILLARRAMENDI, REAL MADRID . Stylish young central midfielder who has lost his way among Real Madrid's stars. Asier Illarramendi may depart Real Madrid this summer and his profile matches Liverpool's recruitment policy . Has stated a desire to fight for his place but knows chances are limited. Liverpool like him, as they do Ruben Neves at Porto also, but face competition from Arsenal and Real Sociedad although Arsene Wenger has other targets too for that area. COST: £18million . MEMPHIS DEPAY, PSV EINDHOVEN . Fits the bill for Brendan Rodgers in terms of pace and pressing style and carries a goal threat. PSG have also made enquiries, as have United, who hope Louis Van Gaal's presence can sway the deal their way. Memphis Depay (right) is an ideal signing for Brendan Rodgers, but he must compete with Europe's elite side .

5477,"Jailed: Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk . A conman has been jailed for stealing a pensioner's entire £401,000 life savings and using it to finance his dream wedding and honeymoon. Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk, a court heard. The 58-year-old siphoned off the £400,001 fortune over an eight-year period but when he was finally arrested he told police: 'I played him.' He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Warwick Crown Court yesterday after admitting fraud and deception after the judge ignored his plea for leniency because he was 'terrified' of going to prison. Sentencing him judge Alan Parker said: 'You plainly saw him as a soft target and you used him, and used him and used him. 'You told lies, some of them beyond wicked, and always you knew he would pay up. 'You lived a lavish lifestyle at the cost of an elderly man's life savings. Society demands that you should be punished.' He told the 80-year-old a string of lies that led to the elderly chartered accountant losing his Birmingham office and was forced to put his 'beautiful' home up for sale, the court heard. Franklin stole his money after telling him his sister had died in Canada and he desperately needed to fly there. He then said his father had died and needed a loan  until he inherited £500,000 - but in fact Franklin's father had died 20 years earlier. Before his fraud was revealed he had said that bailiffs were at the door demanding money. The victim was introduced to Franklin in 2005 and agreed to lend £15,000 for refurbishments to a restaurant Franklin ran in Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire. Shocking: Franklin was jailed at Warwick Crown Court, pictured, which heard that his victim's life was made 'a disaster' because he was left without any money to buy a pint of milk . From there, Franklin fabricated sob story after sob story in an attempt to wring ever more cash from the pensioner, including tens of thousands more in loans. But Franklin, a former car dealership manager, was living the high life and even used the money for his Italian Alps wedding and honeymoon. Meanwhile the pensioner had ran out of money and endured days filled with fear. In a statement, he said the pressure had become overwhelming as Franklin's demands took over his life. 'My financial situation is a disaster,' he added. 'At times we have been so short of money to pay for basic food that we have had to search our pockets to get enough for a litre of milk.' Defending, Lee Marklew said Franklin's personal life had been destroyed by the case, and his wife had left him. 'The thought of the inevitable custodial sentence has been utterly terrifying,' he said. 'Since his arrest it has been a palpable fear which has affected the quality of his life.'

7022,"They are one of the most feared animals on the planet. Now fascinating images reveal how fish make a collective effort to stay out of the way of sharks. The striking photographs show a shoal of fish making way for the blacktip shark swimming in the shallow waters of Heron Island in Queensland, Australia. Incredible images show a shoal of fish making way for a blacktip shark (pictured), perhaps proving that they are instinctively frightened of it . It is thought that the reef shark was not interested in catching a meal, but the fish naturally keep their distance, creating circles of clear water around the predator. Dr Ken Collins, Senior Research Fellow and Diving Officer at the University of Southampton, told MailOnline: 'This is fairly typical behaviour for shoaling fish, the same would happen if it were a diver in the photograph rather than a shark. 'Something big is automatically accepted as a potential threat and swimming in a swirling dense shoal is a defensive move which provides mutual protection simply reducing the chances of an individual being picked off and confusing the potential “enemy"". 'Flocks of small birds will react the same way to hawks.' Fish are thought to gain many benefits from shoaling behaviour, such as keeping safe from predators as well as boosting their chances of feeding and finding a mate. It’s known that shoals of fish can change shapes and directions in seconds - as if they are thinking as one - and in these images, the fish manage to keep a pocket of clear water between themselves and the shark, even the pocket does change shape. Software engineer Scott Carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across the shoal of fish trying to avoid the shark. The photos show a shark swimming in the shallow waters, where they are guaranteed a clear path because ‘terrified’ fish move out of their way . Software engineer Scott Carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across fish trying to avoid the shark off Heron Island in Queensland, Australia (marked) It’s thought that shoals may be an effective means for the majority of fish within them to escape predators’ jaws, because they confuse larger creatures. The ‘predator confusion effect’ is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because similar-looking fish create a sensory overload for predators. Fin movements made by a shoal seem to overlap to mimic waves created by a larger animal, perhaps to dissuade a predator from attacking. The fact that there are many fish in a shoal means they have many eyes to scan an area for predators and keep out of the way. The look-out is shared between individuals to let the group feed safely and swim away from predators as a group. Luckily, the 32-year-old was carrying his camera to snap the scene. ‘There were four blacktip reef sharks circling the area and there was one other type of shark - a lemon shark,’ he said. ‘We walked along the jetty looking down at a large school of fish just beneath the jetty. ‘We noticed a number of reef sharks patrolling the area near the jetty and as we watched the reef sharks slowly moved into the school of fish, with the fish retreating away from the immediate area around the shark. ‘This progressed for about 15 to 20 minutes and a lemon shark joined in on the action late in the piece. ‘It seems like the fish are well aware of the threat and are trying to keep a safer distance from it. They want to avoid being eaten!’ He noted that the sharks were ‘remarkably calm’ when moving though the fish. ‘It was certainly not what I would describe as a feeding frenzy at the time. ‘There was an occasional swift manoeuvre to attempt to catch a fish and the sharks were successful in some of these attempts. He added: ‘Watching the continuous parting of the school of fish as each shark moved through the mass of fish was absolutely spectacular!’ Whether fish feel fear (illustrated by a still from the film Finding Nemo' is a slippery question for scientists. Some studies claim that fish feel pain, but shoaling behaviour's thought to be purely instinctive . Software engineer Scott Carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across the shoal of fish trying to avoid the sharks (pictured left and right) near a jetty . Whether fish have emotions, is a slippery question for scientists, whose studies have shown that they can feel pain in an abstract way, as well as other emotions. Whether fish feel fear, or simply act instinctively, they swim in large shoals that offer individuals more protection from predators than going it alone. Shifts in the shape of the shoal is thought to be driven by feeding, travelling and avoiding predators. It’s thought that shoals may be an effective means for the majority of fish within them to escape predators’ jaws, because they confuse larger creatures. Proposed in 1978, the ‘predator confusion effect’ is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because the many moving targets create a sensory overload of the predator's visual channel – a theory that’s been proved in the wild and in computer simulations. There is also a theory that fin movements made by a shoal overlap to mimic waves created by a larger animal, perhaps to dissuade a predator from attacking. It’s possible that if one shark was found among the shoal (pictured) and others around it, they could act collectively to corral a shoal for a quick meal. The fact that there are many fish in a shoal means they have many eyes to scan an area for predators and keep out of the way. The look-out is shared between individuals to let the group feed safely and swim away from predators as a group. It’s possible that if one shark was found among the shoal and others around it, they could act collectively to corral a shoal. This behaviour isn’t common in sharks, but dolphins have been shown to surround and herd fish as a group, while individuals take it in turns to swim through the shoal, eating unlucky members. Corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured and Atlantic bottlenose dolphins even chase fish onto mud banks for an easy meal. In the shark world, Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fish. Before striking they confine lots of fish in a small space by swimming round them, and then splash then strike them with the upper lobe of the tail to stun them.","Photographs show reef shark passing though a shoal in Queensland .

9537,"The will of Princess Diana is among 41 million available to order at the click of a button. Diana’s final wishes for the disposal of her £21.4 million estate are among a vast archive of wills dating back to 1858 now available to view online. Those of Winston Churchill and George Orwell can also be seen. In her will, Diana’s butler Paul Burrell was bequeathed the sum of £50,000, free of inheritance tax. Scroll down for video . The will of Princess Diana is among 41 million available to order at the click of a button thanks to a new service . Possessions including paintings and a clock were distributed among her 17 godchildren, while the rest went to her sons William and Harry. Qadir Ahmed runs the secure Iron Mountain facility in a leafy suburb of Birmingham where row upon row of the documents are kept in temperature-controlled storage, under tight security. He said the wills are a fascinating snapshot into the personalities and characters of people from every walk of life. For some, having a copy of a will is a matter of sentimentality, whereas others - particularly in the case of celebrities - are ordered out of 'pure curiosity', he said. 'We have 41 million in storage and there are so many fascinating and emotional stories,' said Mr Ahmed. One such is that of the late Paul Hunter, the champion snooker player, who died of cancer in 2006 aged just 27. Paul Burrell was given £50,000 by Diana when she died . The Yorkshireman fathered a daughter who, at the time he penned his will, was not yet born but she is remembered in the passages of his will, as Mr Ahmed describes. 'There are some really touching stories inside these files - people like Paul Hunter, who in his will says 'To my unborn child, I leave ...' and that is genuinely touching. 'He believed at the time he was writing this will, that he wouldn't survive the birth of his child.' 'You feel the emotion of that moment, through reading the record.' The first disbursement of Diana's will reads: 'I bequeath to my butler Paul Burrell the sum of £50,000, free of inheritance tax.' It also provides for specified keepsakes including watercolour paintings and a carriage clock to be distributed among her 17 godchildren, while to Princes William and Harry she left everything else. In the event of her death she makes express provision the Prince of Wales 'will consult with my mother [Frances Shand Kydd] with regard to the upbringing, education and welfare of our children'. She also makes clear her wish to be buried. Mr Ahmed said the new system, which has been in place since the end of last year, means people no longer have to order wills by post, or by heading to their local Registry Office. 'A lot of the public are not aware these are public records,' he said. 'Once someone goes through probate, that's it. It's a simple process, through the gov.uk website. 'You can pay a small fee of £10 and order a record of anyone who's gone through probate, searching by the person's name and year of death.' Among the other celebrity wills, are those of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, creator of Winnie the Pooh AA Milne and George Orwell - under his real name Eric Blair - who penned 1984. Data centre manager Qadir Ahmed inspects one of the more than 41 million public wills held in secure storage at the Iron Mountain facility in Birmingham . Churchill, who died in 1965, left an estate worth £266,054 which he asked to be divided between his wife and children. He gave his country home Chartwell, in Kent, to the National Trust to be a museum after his death. As well as other bequests of cash to his wife, children, family and friends, he also left money to his employees, including £100 for his gardener. His son-in-law, Arthur Christopher John Soames, was given 'such of my brood mares, followers and fillies' from Churchill's stable, but with the caveat his choices were ""not exceeding three in number, nor £7,500 in total value'. Also stored away is the will of wartime code-breaker Alan Turing, recently played in Hollywood movie The Imitation Game by Benedict Cumberbatch. Turing's brief final testament directs his possessions be left to close friends and his mother. Meanwhile, Orwell - listed under his birth name Blair - left instructions 'no biography be written' and 'no memorial service be held for me after my death'.","Diana's will is among those stored in an archive which is to be put online .

7573,"Nineties style is hot right now. Chokers, berry-coloured lips, round sunglasses and Calvin Klein logo T-shirts are all the rage with a new generation of fashion fans. But news that JNCO, the brand responsible for the huge wideleg 'rave' jeans, is set to make a comeback has horrified many of the people who wore the ridiculous pants the first time around. The return of the highly impractical jeans, which featured giant leg openings approaching 50in, has us contemplating the retro fashion Nineties and Noughties trends that really should be left in the past. Femail rounds up the worst offenders... Scroll down for video . JCNO jeans, popular at Nineties raves, are threatening to make a comeback . 1. THE BUCKET HAT . A casual Nighties piece, the bucket hat is characterised by its wide, downwards sloping brim and limp structure. Originally a staple of fishermen and farmers, it soon enough found its way into popular culture and temporarily dominated the music scene. After gaining prominence in the Nineties and early Noughties, the trend was ditched in favour of softer and more flattering shapes, but fashion-forward celebrities such as 27-year-old Rihanna aren't letting it go quietly. THEN: The bucket hat was originally a staple of fishermen and farmers, but seeped into popular culture, and was sported by the likes of singer Christina Aguilera, now 36, in 2001 . NOW: Pop star Rihanna, 27, was spotted in July 2014 wearing a floppy bucket hat . 2. CAMOUFLAGE PRINT . For those of us non-military personnel not in need of immediate concealment from predators, very few can understand why time and time again, camouflage print manages to seep into our wardrobes. Usually in variations of olive and khaki - but also available in more garish shades - the pattern consists of shapeless blobs that imitate foliage. The brash pattern was favoured by Noughties bands such as Beyoncé's former band, Destiny's Child and today is seen on silk pants or sports luxe trousers worn by street smart stars such as 24-year-old Jourdan Dunn. Beyoncé, now 33, was a big fan of camouflage print in 2001 back when she was still with Destiny's Child . THEN: Destiny's Child wore camouflage print in garish variations of bright blue back in 2001 . NOW: Jourdan Dunn, 24, attempted to bring back the camouflage look in the form of skinny trousers and a crop top in February 2015 . 3. TAKING IT TO THE MAX . Sometimes a trend becomes so popular that a few fashion-forward thinking individuals try to take it to the extreme. Designer prints and double denim are two styles that worked well for celebrity wardrobes in the Nineties, . And today young reality star, 17-year-old Kylie Jenner is one of many who definitely don't follow the 'less is more' style mantra. THEN: In the Noughties, pop stars such as Victoria Beckham, now 44 (pictured left in 2000), Britney Spears, now 33, and Justin Timberlake, now 34 (pictured middle to right in 2001), loved to take trends to the maximum . NOW: 17-year-old reality star Kylie Jenner sported double denim out and about in Los Angeles earlier this month . 4. UGG BOOTS . The shapeless sheepskin UGG boot was a huge celebrity trend in the Noughties, with heiress Paris Hilton, 34, owning piles of pairs. They are not pretty, or remotely glamorous, but the cosy factor means that they remain popular with off-duty actors and models today, with actress Kristen Bell, 34, being one of the more modern fashion offenders. THEN: Heiress Paris Hilton wore UGG boots at Heathrow in 2006 and NOW: Kristen Bell wears hers on set between takes earlier this month . 5. DAISY DUKES . Tiny, tiny denim shorts have been around for the longest time, but were brought back to popularity by Jessica Simpson, 34 (pictured below), in the film remake of The Dukes of Hazzard in 2005. Extremely frayed, and impractically short, most stylish women are opting for slightly longer, more conservative styles this summer. But we can always count on Miley Cyrus, 22, to keep things flirty - wearing hers cut seriously high on the thigh. THEN: Tiny denim shorts, aka Daisy Dukes, were reintroduced to our wardrobes by Jessica Simpson with the promotion of the film reboot of The Dukes of Hazzard in 2005 . 6. JUICY COUTURE TRACKSUITS . Juicy Couture's matching two-piece velour tracksuits were the staple wardrobe of the likes of Nicole Richie, 33, Paris Hilton, 34, and Britney Spears, 33, in the Noughties. Available in all manner of garish shades, they were perfect for lounging around the house in and today celebrities like Nicki Minaj, 32, are keeping the rainbow sweatpants in style. THEN:  Britney Spears stepped out in a Juicy Couture velour tracksuits in 2005 before her wedding to Kevin Federline . NOW: Nicki Minaj stepped out in 2014 in the red version of the Juicy Couture tracksuit, proving that it's maintained its popularity since the Noughties . 7. COLOURED SUNGLASSES . Rainbow lenses were a Nineties favourite for boy bands such as *NSYNC and pop princesses like Britney. These days they are sported by the likes of the mostly very stylish 22-year-old model Cara Delevingne and 17-year-old reality star, Kylie Jenner, with a mirrored sheen giving them a 2015 update. Shady bunch: Justin Timberlake, now 34 (pictured left in 2000), and Britney Spears, now 33 (pictured right in 1999), were fans of brightly coloured sunglasses in the Nineties . NOW: Model Cara Delevingne and reality star Kylie Jenner are both fans of coloured sunglasses . 8. CORSETS AS OUTFITS . Corsets first became popular in the 16th Century, worn under clothes to help transform women's shapes. In the Nineties they were being sported as outerwear, spearheaded by a very sexy Victoria Backham as Posh Spice, now 44.

5730,"A man, 21, allegedly forced a tearful 15-year-old girl into his car on Saturday and screamed, 'you will never see your parents again!' in attempt to force her to be his teen bride. Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment. The Star Tribune reports that the girl's family reported the kidnapping on Sunday and that they opposed to their daughter marrying Xiong, whom she was dating, because of their age differences. Alleged kidnapper: Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St.Paul, Minnesota has been arrested after he allegedly tried to force his 15-year-old girlfriend to be his traditional Hmong bride . Xiong and his parents say they wanted the girl and Xiong to marry in the Hmong tradition. The girl, who has not been identified because she is a minor, told police that Xiong was her 'boyfriend' and that they got into a physical argument over the prospect of marriage on Saturday night. Xiong allegedly threw the girl's iPad against a wall at her family's home and then ripped her sweatpants as he dragged her into his car. Her parents were not home at the time. The girl told police that she managed to escape but that Xiong took hold of her a second time, forced her into his car, and took her to his family's home. When the girl's parents returned home from work at around noon on Sunday, they learned of the kidnapping from their oldest son. The girl's parents called Xiong's parents and demanded that they give them their daughter back. The girl's older brother later drove to the Xiong's home where they willingly let the girl go home. The girl told police that she and Xiong had been 'dating' in January and first had sex when she was just 14-years-old. The victim's father told police that Xiong asked him to marry his daughter on multiple occasions but that he said no because of their large age difference. Xiong admitted to kidnapping the girl and said that she tried to escape from him on Highway 26. This is not Xiong's first brush with the law. In 2009 Xiong was tried in juvenile court or sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl when he was 15. He pleaded guilty. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said about the case, 'This is a very disturbing case involving the victimization of a 15-year-old girl that cannot be tolerated in our community. 'Women and girls are not property, they are human beings who have every right to be free from violence and to live according to how they choose for themselves. 'We allege that the defendant has sexually exploited a minor who cannot legally consent to sex, and has taken violent actions to kidnap and hold the victim against her will.' According to Hmongculture.net, the Hmong are an ethnic group that come from Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. In the late 1980s many Hmong people came to the United States after being sponsored by the Lutheran church. The majority relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota and Fresno, California. In traditional Hmong marriages the man generally asks permission from the girl's family to wed her. If that method fails, there is a tradition of 'bride-napping' in Hmong culture in which the man may literally drag his bride to his house when her parents are not home. If the girl does not accept a gift from her sometimes forceful suitor then she may go back to her family, says Ahmongwoman.com .","Kong Meng Xiong, 21, of St. Paul, Minnesota has been charged with kidnapping, third-degree criminal sexual conduct and false imprisonment .

7141,"Relatives of Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are refusing to accept that he was behind the marathon terrorist attack and want his defense lawyers fired. The convicted bomber's aunt, Maret Tsarnaeva, and two other relatives told Time in an interview this week in Chechen capital, Grozny, that they believed he was wrongly convicted as part of a conspiracy by the U.S. The bomber's uncle, Said-Hussein Tsarnaev, told the magazine that 'American special services' orchestrated the 2013 terrorist attack which left three dead and hundreds more wounded. Scroll down for video . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's aunt, Maret Tsarnaeva, claimed in an interview this week that her nephew Dzhokhar (right) had been wrongfully convicted in the Boston bombing as part of a U.S. conspiracy . Martin Richard, who was killed in the bombings, is seen (front circle) just meters away from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (back circle) on April 15, 2013.Seconds later, one of two bombs exploded, piercing his body with shrapnel . The family members could offer no evidence to back up their allegations. Tsarnaev was found guilty by a Boston jury on April 8 of all 30 counts - 17 of them carrying the death penalty - in connection to the deadly April 2013 attacks. The relatives have also attempted to get messages to Tsarnaev, urging him to fire his defense lawyers. However it appears that this request was now at odds with Tsarnaev's mother, who ranted in the wake of his guilty conviction on April 8 that her mass-murderer son is 'the best of the best'. The family is at war over whether to keep the defense team, including attorney Judy Clarke, who were attempting to prevent Tsarnaev being sentenced to the death penalty. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva 'would not listen to reason', the relatives told Time. The mother has continued to insist that Dzhokhar and his late brother Tamerlan were innocent, a position she has upheld since the brothers were pinpointed as the perpetrators of the atrocity two years ago. Zealot: Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat (pictured left in April 2013) sent a text message (right) of support in response to her surviving son's guilty verdict saying America was the real terrorist . A sketch shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (second left) and his defense team as the guilty verdicts on all charges against him were read on April 8. The jury will now decide if he gets the death penalty . In a text message to her son's supporter, Timur Rudaev, Mrs Tsarneava called the convicted killer 'my precious boy' before going on a rant against the US. 'America is the real terrorist and everyone knows that,' she wrote in the text, which was later shared on the Russian social media site VKontakte and sent to the news site Vocativ. 'My boys are the best of the best,' Mrs Tsarnaev added. She effusively thanked everyone who have been helping her family over the past two years and vowed to keep them in her thoughts. 'May God reward them for supporting my precious boy,' the mother wrote. Rudaev, a resident of Grozny, Chechnya, uploaded Mrs Tsrarnaev's text onto a VKontakte group called Help Dzhokhar Tsrarnaev, which he reportedly launched back in 2013. Zubeidat Tsranaev's statement was accompanied by Rudaev’s rambling rant about Dzhokhar’s guilty verdict in Boston. 'Today, foolish Americans completely shattered the life of a great guy!' Rudaev wrote in Russian. 'But no trial, no jury could trample our opinions, only the Almighty has power over us! Only the Almighty knows the outcome of this trial... we hope the merciful Allah will give Dzhokar a second chance!' Rudaev went on saying that he hopes that in the near future, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, will gather everyone at her home to celebrate Dzhokar's release. 'Everyone will be ruffling his hair and telling him, ''Brother, you persevered, you put the Americans in their place!''' Zubeidat Tsarnaev has been unwavering in her support for Tamerlan, 26, who was killed in a gun battle with police after the bombings, and his younger brother, who was arrested after being cornered inside a boat in a Boston suburb. In the days after the attack, Zubeidat accused law enforcement in Boston of framing her sons and described the scene of carnage at the marathon finish line as a 'really big play’ with 'paint instead of blood.' During a press conference held 10 days after the bombings, the mother was on the verge of hysteria proclaiming she did not accept that her children were responsible for the massacre. ‘America took my kids away from me. I’m sure my kids were not involved in anything,’ she raved. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev appeared unmoved as the guilty verdict was announced in court last Wednesday. The same jury panel that found him guilty after 12 hours of deliberations will now have to decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or give him life in prison without the possibility of parole. The sentencing phase of the trial begins on April 21. COUNT 1: GUILTY . Conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, resulting in death (Death penalty charge) COUNT 2: GUILTY .

250,"Los Angeles (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" earlier this year. In addition to that ruling, Judge Ronald Coen also lowered Knight's bail to $10 million from $25 million, a figure that defense lawyers called excessive. The judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against Knight. In all, Knight will stand trial on one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run, the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended Thursday. Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted. Knight suffers diabetes and blot clots, and the case has clearly strained him: He collapsed in court last month after learning of the $25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment. Knight was in court Thursday. At the end of hearing, he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery, and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom. In a press conference after the hearing, fiancee Toi Kelly said regarding Knight's health that he is ""doing much better."" The judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because California law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon, in this case the vehicle Knight was driving, is used against several people. Knight is accused of running over two men, killing one of them, during an argument. Killed was Terry Carter, 55. The survivor is Cle Sloan, 51, who in testimony this week declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan doesn't want to be a ""snitch"" who sends Knight to prison, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity, but he still refused to testify against Knight on Monday, the affiliates reported. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. At the time, Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case. The hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows Knight inside a red truck. In the video, the truck pulls into the entrance of the Compton restaurant, and he is then approached by Sloan, who was working security on the site. The two men appear to talk for a few moments, with Knight still in his vehicle. Suddenly, the vehicle backs up, knocking Sloan to the ground. While still in reverse, the truck moves out of range of the security camera. The vehicle is then seen zooming forward, back into camera range, running over Sloan a second time, and then running over a second man, Carter, a former rap music label owner. Carter later died. In closing arguments prior to the judge's ruling, Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher argued that Knight was the victim. Knight was only defending himself against Sloan, whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time. ""Mr. Sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor,"" Knight's attorney argued. ""There's no intent to kill, there's an intent to survive."" ""Even without a gun, we know Mr. Sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight,"" the defense attorney said. Fletcher added that Knight's defense was to stand his ground. Sloan ""needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor,"" Fletcher said. ""He is the person who got Terry (Carter) killed."" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes argued, however, told the judge that Knight was engaged in ""mutual combat situation"" where he used his car as deadly weapon. If Knight ""ever had the right of self-defense, the moment he backed-up and Mr. Sloan was ran-over, he lost the right of self-defense,"" Barnes said. ""There was pre-mediation and intent when he (Knight) ran over him a second time."" Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (now known as Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards.","Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight will be tried for murder in a videotaped hit-and-run .

Loretta Reinholdt, 54, and Andy Wasinger, 46, were on their second day into a trip from Belize to the Honduran island of Roatan in which they were learning to sail on a 17-meter-long hired boat with a captain when they were attacked. Four men with guns and knives boarded the sailboat and took all of their money after waving down the sailboat by asking for gas. Reinholdt (left) and Wasinger (right) were on a hired sailboat with a captain two weeks ago when four men waved them down, boarded the boat with guns and knives and demanded money before pushing their boat to the shore of a remote beach, leaving the couple and captain stranded for four days . 'They were yelling,' Reinholdt, a former nurse, told CBC. 'They were demanding more money. They didn't believe we only had that amount. And the more angry they got, the more scary it was. 'And they actually had me, pulling my hair and a knife on my throat, demanding more money from the captain.' Wasinger, a former computer programmer, added: 'I knew we had to comply with the pirates and not be heroes.' After the terrifying hold-up, the pirates pushed the sailboat to the shoreline of a remote beach in Jeanette Kawas National Park, cut the main sail and tore out the engine wire, leaving the couple and their captain stranded. They also took gasoline, the radio and drinking water from the boat. The couple and captain made SOS messages with branches along a park trail, which was discovered by hikers four days later. 'It was great. It was one of the best moments of my life, I think. I was ecstatic,' Wasinger told CTV News. 'I know we can go through anything in life now after this situation. We are a lot closer as a couple and we live life every day as if it is our last.' During their time in the jungle, they survived on rainwater, peanut butter and cheese and make a make-shift tent to stay in until they were saved. 'We hugged each other, we cried,' Reinholdt told CBS. 'And we couldn't thank them enough for doing this for us, because they were also brave that they actually came to the area. So, it's unbelievable. We were so happy to be alive.' Their rescuers took trio to the town to Tela, where they met Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who happened to be staying in the area. He offered them a presidential helicopter ride to the nearest airport and the country's government handled the bill for the couple to fly to Mexico, where they were sent to recover. Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs told CBS that they were aware of the attack and consular officials at the Tegucigalpa embassy have been in contact with local authorities to gain more information. 'Canadians travelling to Honduras should be aware that serious crime — including armed robbery, kidnapping, carjacking, home invasion and sexual assault — is common, and armed attacks on marine vessels have been reported,' foreign affairs spokesman Nicolas Doire said in a statement. He added that there is a travel advisory regarding safety and security in the country on the the government of Canada's website. And as for Reinhold and Wasinger, they told the Calgary Herald that though this was their first sailing trip, it will likely be their last. Buthey might return to Honduras - only they would stay in populated areas and would not go alone. 'I can't say enough about how the Honduran people helped us,' Reinholdt said. 'Everyone was so friendly.'","Loretta Reinholdt, 54, and Andy Wasinger, 46, were on on a hired sailboat with a captain when they were attacked .

199,"(CNN)Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will need to keep his lawyers even after being convicted of murder and other charges in the death of Odin Lloyd. The 25-year-old potentially faces three more trials -- one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW.  Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The trial was originally slated for May 28, but Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said Wednesday the trial had been postponed and no new date had been set. ""We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track. The Suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the July 16, 2012, shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston's South End; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm,"" he said. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims the then-New England Patriot tight end wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed four months later, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally ""possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have."" Hernandez's lawyers have argued he couldn't defend himself properly while on trial in Massachusetts. There was no criminal charge in the case. And then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the NFL players union on behalf of Hernandez, who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $40 million. If the grievance is heard by the league, Hernandez will be represented by the the National Football League Players' Association. Who was Odin Lloyd? CNN's Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.","Aaron Hernandez has been found guilty in Odin Lloyd's death, but his troubles are not over .

8881,"Thousands of motorists have been fined or had their cars towed away after falling foul of new rules following the switch to digital tax discs. Many are buying used cars unaware that the old paper documents are now automatically cancelled when a vehicle changes hands. Ignorant that they must fork out for a new digital one – even if the existing paper disc is months from expiry – rising numbers of drivers are falling prey to clampers. Scroll down for video . Thousands of law-abiding motorists have had their cars clamped because they were unaware of major vehicle tax rule changes. File photo . Critics allege that the DVLA has been operating a 'money-making scam' after figures yesterday showed clamping soared after the paperless system was introduced in October last year. Many say the authority was too quick to penalise motorists without first warning that their car was not taxed. Drivers have faced bills of up to £800 to get their impounded vehicles back. The Government abolished the paper tax disc (pictured) last autumn . The DVLA was accused of 'heavy-handed and Draconian' behaviour yesterday after figures showed its use of clamping rocketed by 60 per cent from about 5,000 vehicles a month before the changes to 8,630 last month. With no right to appeal against the fines to an independent body, drivers have little choice but to pay up. The DVLA is estimated to be making millions of pounds a year because it receives double road tax payment – from both the seller and the buyer. Christopher and Marianna Webb, from Bridport, Dorset, were hit with an £822 bill to get their Ford Focus back after returning from holiday to find it had been impounded for non-payment of vehicle excise duty. The couple decided to swap their cars with each other and informed the DVLA of the change in ownership, without realising it meant the tax for both vehicles would be cancelled. Mr Webb, 56, told The Guardian: 'I feel they are very heavy-handed. Why did they not send a reminder letter?' Pete Hallam, whose car was also clamped, said: 'This is shady practice and reminiscent of the car parking wheel clampers a few years ago. It is a money-making scam.' Paul Watters of the AA said there had been only limited publicity from the DVLA about the changes to the vehicle tax system. 'There are a lot of people who are not aware of this – some may think they are covered because they see there is a tax disc on the windscreen,' he said. 'Clamping is quite heavy-handed and Draconian. Before they clamp they should try to get in touch with these people if they can.' A DVLA spokesman said: 'The changes have been widely publicised and we write to every vehicle keeper to remind them of the new rules before the vehicle tax expires. 'We also write to every new vehicle keeper when they buy a used vehicle to inform them that they must tax the vehicle before they use it. 'In addition, if a driver does not tax their car we will send a warning letter to remind them to tax as they are at risk of enforcement action.'","Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency abolished paper tax disc last autumn .

8242,"A pensioner has broke down in tears in court as he was spared jailed after admitting he stabbed his sick wife to death after she begged him to 'bring her suffering to an end'. Anthony Mann, 78, sat quietly sobbing in the dock as he listened to the details of the mercy killing of his wife Janet at their home in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. He was given a two year suspended sentence after he appeared at Leamington Justice Centre today. Anthony Mann was spared jail for killing his wife Janet after she asked him to end his life . As his trial opened, the prosecution outlined how Mann plunged a kitchen knife into his wife's chest in a moment of impulse. The court was told how Mann was a devoted father and husband, who had been married to Janet for a number of years after they first met as teenagers. However, since 2008, Mrs Mann's health had deteriorated and by the middle of 2014, she was suffering from dementia, was unable to go to the toilet alone and was in chronic pain. Peter Grieve-Smith, prosecuting, said: 'The strain on Mr Mann was enormous and on June 20 at 2.20am he made a 999 call and said he had killed his wife. 'He said he had stabbed her and that she had asked him to do it. 'When the police arrived they found Janet Mann lying on her bed on her back with a knife sticking out of her abdomen. 'She had died through a stab wound to her heart.' A police van outside the home of Anthony and Janet Mann in Nuneaton after Mr Mann stabbed his sick wife to death after she begged him to bring her suffering to an end . In a statement to police Mann said his wife had been in a distressed state and had told him she had had enough. He said: 'She was screaming and said she did not want live like this. I went to the kitchen and got a knife and stabbed her. I kissed her and said I love you.' The couple's two daughters both said in statements that their dad was a loving, kind man and defending QC Jonas Hankin said: 'This is a tragic case of a mercy killing.' The prosecution then asked for the original charge of murder to be replaced by one of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, to which Mann pleaded guilty. The judge, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: 'This is an exceptionally sad and tragic case. Janet Mann had suffered ill health for a number of years and her husband was her devoted and constant carer. 'She did not want to suffer any more and, under terrific strain, her husband acted in a moment of impulse.' Mann pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility at Leamington Justice Centre, pictured . The judge said he accepted the conclusions of two psychiatrists that, on the night of the killing, the defendant had been suffering a mental disorder, brought on by the 'enormous pressure' he was under. Addressing Mann he added: 'Neither of your daughters bears any resentment towards you and each has expressed relief that their mother's suffering has ended. 'You have been an industrious, hard-working man who has led an utterly decent life, devoted to your wife and family.' In a statement issued through his solicitor at the end of the trial, Mann said: 'The family are all relieved that Janet is no longer suffering and I am grateful of their support throughout this difficult time. 'The end of Janet's severe pain and distress is all that this case has been about. Janet was a very special lady and her family and friends all love and miss her greatly.'","Anthony Mann admitted killing his wife Janet who suffered from dementia .

2766,"West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce believes his squad are unable to deal with the rigours of a full Barclays Premier League season after they dropped points by conceding late against Stoke City. Allardyce’s contract expires at the end of the season but he feels his work at Upton Park is far from done and wants to oversee the development of a squad lacking in top-flight experience. The West Ham starting XI on Saturday included six summer signings with Carl Jenkinson and Alex Song the only ones to have played in the Premier League before. Sam Allardyce believes his squad are unable to deal with the rigours of a full Premier League season . Allardyce’s contract expires at the end of the season but he feels his work at Upton Park is far from done .

Much like their season as a whole, the Hammers started strongly against Stoke before wasting their efforts with a lack of concentration late on. ‘The early part of the season is about the players achieving great heights,’ Allardyce said. ‘I think that as the squad has found at this stage they’re finding the nitty gritty of the Premier League and that is the physical and mental fatigue that they’ve not experienced. ‘I talk about Aaron Cresswell, I could talk about Carl Jenkinson. All of a sudden it’s week after week, pressure after pressure, performance after performance. Our new players from abroad, Cheikhou (Kouyate), (Diafra) Sakho, (Enner) Valencia, have all done brilliant but they’re feeling the pace a little bit. 'Next season they'll be better, they'll be more experienced, they'll be more able to cope than they have been this season.' Among the new arrivals on Saturday was former Ipswich Town left back Cresswell, who scored with a brilliant free-kick before Marko Arnautovic’s 95th-minute equaliser. West Ham had dominated early on and Cresswell’s curling effort left goalkeeper Asmir Begovic flummoxed to open the scoring. West Ham had dominated early on and Aaron Cresswell’s curling effort from a free-kick gave them the lead . Diafra Sakho is among those said to be struggling with the tail end of the season, and he limped off . But Stoke grew into the game as the home side waned and Arnautovic had two goals ruled out for offside either side of Mame Biram Diouf hitting the inside of the post with a header. The fired-up Austrian wasn’t to be denied though and he eventually shot across Adrian’s goal and into the corner with seconds left to spark wild celebrations in front of the away end. It was a familiar scene for the home support whose reaction at the final whistle indicated that they do not see Allardyce as the man in charge as this inexperienced side grows.

The 17-year-old Albertville, Alabama high school junior was proud to be escorted by her grandfather to the annual end-of-year dance this weekend. Webb told Daily Mail Online that she asked her 80-year-old 'Poppa' James Drain to prom because he never got to attend the dance himself.

So Joy asked her principal for permission, and he agreed to make an exception for the 21 age limit. About a month ago, when her grandfather was over for dinner, Joy asked if he would be her date and he agreed. 'She said ""I would love that! You’re the one I wanted! Hey, will you come to the prom with me and be my beau?"" And I said I sure will!' Drain told WHNT about the sweet promposal. Like most prom nights, the festivities kicked off at Joy's house where she pinned a boutonniere on her Poppa and he wrapped a corsage around her wrist. They then took pictures in front of the house in their evening wear, marking another first for Drain who has never worn a tuxedo. Getting ready: On Saturday night, Drain came over to his granddaughter's house and the two swapped a boutonniere and corsage for the event . Prom pictures: Then, like typical prom dates, the two posted for pictures outside Joy's house in their evening wear .

Drain then escorted his granddaughter to Mater's restaurant for prom dinner, where he had a special surprise waiting for the granddaughter he calls 'Princess'. After finishing their meal, the two took a horse and carriage ride around the town before dropping them off at the school for the dance. 'We were the first ones on the dance floor because my poppa loves to dance,' Joy said. Joy says her grandfather and grandmother used to go dancing all the time, but that they had to stop a few years ago when her grandmother got sick. Her grandmother died two years ago on Thanksgiving, and Joy says her grandfather now commutes to a senior center in a nearby town ever Friday night to dance. 'He inspires us to keep living no matter what happens,' Joy said. Drain was apparently the life of the party at the prom, with Joy's friends coming over to say high to and dance with the man they so often see at show choir and band concerts. Life of the party: Joy says her friends were excited when they learned that she would be bringing her 'Poppa' to prom.

2876,"Stuart McCall admits he will become a Livingston fan for the day on Wednesday as he prays the Scottish Championship strugglers can do his side's play-off bid a favour. Livingston gave Rangers a headache last week when they held them to a 1-1 draw at the Energy Assets Arena and they now take on Hibernian in midweek. The Easter Road outfit slipped four points behind McCall's side on Saturday while they were busy getting knocked out of the William Hill Scottish Cup by Falkirk as Rangers were winning 3-1 at Dumbarton in league action. Stuart McCall has revealed he will be cheering on Livingston during their match against Hibernian . McCall believes his side's main promotion rivals could drop points against Livingston on Wednesday . Rangers dropped points against Livingston by drawing 1-1 with the Scottish Championship strugglers . Rangers are four points ahead of Hibernian . However, Hibs can close back to within a point of second place if they win their game in hand with Mark Burchill's Livingston. With both teams desperate to finish as runners-up to new champions Hearts and spare themselves two extra hazardous games in the play-offs, McCall is now praying Livi give Hibs as hard a time as they did his side. He said: 'I'll be there on Wednesday with my Livingston scarf on. We played them and know what a tough game it will be. Hibs will be disappointed with what happened at Hampden but they'll now focus on promotion and we've got to focus on ourselves - we've got two big games left and want to win both.' Rangers clinched the points at the weekend after 18-year-old striker Ryan Hardie claimed a dream double on his full debut. Former Celtic striker Mark Wilson put the Sons ahead after just two minutes with his first goal since netting an Old Firm winner against Gers back in March 2011, but Hardie saved the day with his brace before Haris Vuckic swept home a 25-yeard beauty to put the seal on the Glasgow side's victory. McCall was delighted for his young frontman Hardie - but was cautious when asked if the teenager could be the man to fire Rangers back to the Premiership. 'We only told Ryan at lunchtime that he was playing, we showed him the areas of the park we wanted him to get into and that's where his first goal came from,' said the Gers boss. 'The kid is a goalscorer and he's got great energy and good pace. He's very raw naturally because he's only young but you can't do much more than score two on your debut. 'I'm delighted for the kid and hopefully that's him on his way to a lot of goals for Rangers. I'm a horses for courses manager and we'll change things but Ryan did what we hoped he would do and his confidence is high so it's a nice problem for next week.' On-loan Newcastle playmaker Vuckic's goal was a sublime strike but McCall admits he had to give the Slovenian a half-time talking to after he went missing for Wilson's opener.

'He carries a goal threat and we're delighted he's doing that. He got a bit of a roasting at half-time because Mark Wilson was his man and he switched off. When you play in wide areas you've got to have the nous and desire to track back. 'He switched off for a second and it landed where he should have been. But we'll forgive him because of his goal.

6778,"A size 24 woman who spent years gorging on discounted snacks on the supermarket she works at has lost seven stone after ditching the habit. Leanne Kenny, 23, from Northwich, Cheshire, reached almost 20 stone after repeatedly taking home end-of-the-line discounted junk food. The supermarket worker would snack on bumper bars of chocolate, baked goods and fizzy drinks going cheap because of their sell-by dates. Leanne Kenny ballooned to almost 20st after snacking on leftover goods at her place of work, but after ditching the snacks Leanne has lost 7st and now weighs in at 13st . It wasn't until she broke down in a shop changing room when she couldn't squeeze into their largest dress that she finally resolved to lose weight and cut out her unhealthy post-work snacks. Following her strict diet and fitness regime Leanne has shed seven stone and has shrunk down to 13 stone. Leanne says that she had always struggled with her weight but the real problem began after starting her job in the Co-op. Leanne worked as a check out girl at the Co-op and would snack on discounted products every day . Leanne says that she had always struggled with her weight and was teased when she was in school . Leanne says her break through moment came when she was unable to fit into the largest size in a store . 'Even as a child, I was the biggest one among my friends but my weight really became a problem when I started my supermarket job and couldn't resist the discounted treats,' she said. 'I would get teased at high school but I put on such a confident front, laughing off the hurtful comments and plastering myself in makeup just to make myself feel better.' By the age of 16, Leanne was already a size 20 and felt too embarrassed to go out with her friends so she swapped nights out with staying in wearing sweat pants and drinking fizzy drinks. Leanne started her job as a team leader at Co-op in 2010, aged 19, and she began piling on the pounds. By December 2013, she weighed 19st 3lb and went shopping for a new dress but broke down in tears when she couldn't fit into the store's size 24. Leanne said: 'When I started working at Co-op, I found out that lots of food was discounted at the end of the shift. Leanne joined Weight Watchers and took up walking in a bid to shed the weight . 'I couldn't resist the temptation. I would tell myself that I was bringing it home so that the food wouldn't be wasted or would share it between my family but to be honest I would bring home food anyway whether it was cheap or not and it would all be for me.' Aware that she was gaining weight Leanne attempted some weight-loss regimes but she would quickly give up. 'As my weight increased, I did try some diets but I just couldn't stick with any of them. I'd get hungry at work and then couldn't resist the delicious snacks that were on offer. 'My weight soared but I ignored it until I couldn't any longer - and couldn't even fit into a size 24. Leanne, now a size 14, plans to drop a further dress size by the summer. Pictured here in her old work uniform . 'It was the dress incident where something finally clicked in my head. Instead of coming home with a beautiful brand new dress I had to order a frumpy one online from a plus-sized store - I was mortified.' It was this light-bulb moment that finally saw Leanne make a dramatic change to her lifestyle. 'A week later I signed up to my local Weight Watchers. I immediately cut out bread and sugar and focused on walking. Within six months I got into the swing of it and would walk every day - and managed to lose four stone. 'Instead of stocking up on cakes, chocolate and crisps, I opted for fruit, veg and other healthy snacks instead. And I've never felt better.' Leanne says that one of her proudest moments came when she visited a department store and was able to try on clothes. Leanne credits her boyfriend Dan (pictured with her before weight loss) for keeping her motivated . 'I went to Debenhams in April and managed to fit into a pair of size 18 trousers. This time I cried tears of happiness - it was a long way from the last time I was in a high street changing room.' Leanne says that ditching her habit for after work snacks had been tricky but she had found something else to take home instead. 'The hardest thing has been stopping myself taking treats home from work, but I persevered and now take home fruit or vegetables.' Now Leanne is down to a size 14 and regularly visits the gym, running every night and visiting four times a week. She credits her boyfriend of four years Daniel Tittensor for keeping her motivated throughout her weight loss and aims to lose another stone to reach her goal of being a size 12 by the summer. 'In December 2014, I wore a size 14 dress which was a dream come true,' said Leanne. 'It made all the hard work worthwhile. The past year had been the hardest of my life, forcing myself to resist temptations, but now I can finally have bread and chocolate although in moderation.' Leanne added: 'I never thought I would be able to do it. All it takes is a heck of a lot of willpower and dedication. I've kept an old dress and pair of trousers to remind me of how big I once was. I can fit both of my legs in one leg of my old trousers now! 'I have never felt so good and for once I can look in the mirror and feel happy at what I see - no more discounted goods for me.'",Leanne Kenny reached 20st after starting work as a check out girl .

10813,"A grandmother was left feeling 'sick and scared' after she received a chilling ransom demand for her stolen dog. Vivienne Garton, 65, was devastated her 10-year-old West Highland terrier Ben was snatched from her garden in Knowle West, Bristol, earlier this month. She began an appeal to find him and put up posters near her home, but shortly after she received two phone calls from an anonymous man threatening to cut up her pet unless she paid £500. Scared: Vivienne Garton, 65, has been left devastated after her West Highland terrier Ben was stolen. She put posters (pictured) up near her home but since received an anonymous call threatening to cut up the dog . The caller gave the address of an empty house in Bristol and a phone number which she handed to police, who are now investigating. Mrs Garton, who lives with her husband and four grandchildren aged between eight and 18, says a number of her posters have now been ripped down. 'I feel sick. I have had him for ten years - he is my little baby. I just want him home safe. I'm so worried. I don't know who could do that to someone,' she said. 'I don't know if it is a hoax or if he has really been stolen by someone. It is scary. It was a man on the phone and he sounded middle aged. He said he would cut Ben up.' Loving pet: Mrs Garton's 10-year-old dog is partially sighted, partially deaf and cannot walk long distances and has been missing for a fortnight . Ben, who is partially sighted, partially deaf and cannot walk long distances, disappeared from the family home on Sunday April 12. Mrs Garton, who suffers from arthritis, explained that she sent the dog outside because he was hassling her while she was cooking Sunday lunch. But when Ben failed to come back  she grew concerned and went outside to find a hole in the hedge. She said that while it was possible he could have escaped it was very out of character and was unlikely that he wouldn't return. She said: 'There was a little hole in the hedge that he might have got through, but it is very out of character for him not to come back. 'We went straight out looking for him but there has been no sign of him ever since. I am worried he has been stolen and somebody has him in their garage.' A social media campaign, started by her neighbours, is becoming increasingly popular in the hope of returning the pet. She added: 'Friends in the area have been great and I have so much support from people. We are all worried sick and must have driven about 300 miles in the past week just looking for him. 'Sometimes we cross paths with other people out doing the same thing. The entire family is worried and stressed out about him. We've always been a dog-loving family - I have had dogs ever since I was little. Ben is the smallest one we've ever had and he is a member of the family now.' A spokeswoman for Avon and Somerset police said: 'We have received reports of threatening phone calls in relation to a lost dog. We are investigating an incident of blackmail.'

5436,"An undergraduate student at Duke University has admitted to hanging a noose in a tree and is no longer on campus, university officials said Thursday. At a news conference Thursday afternoon, school spokesman Michael Schoenfeld said the school would not release the name of the student who admitted to hanging the noose, found early Wednesday in a plaza area at the heart of the campus. The student was identified with information provided by other students and will be subject to Duke's student conduct process and that an investigation is continuing to find out if others were involved, Schoenfeld said. Identified: Officials at Duke University say they have caught the student culprit responsible for hanging a noose from a tree on campus this week . Taking a stand: The noose sparked a mass protest on campus on Wednesday. The noose is a particularly sensitive image in the state, where black residents were once terrorized by lynchings . Schoenfeld said the school believes federal education laws protecting information about students and their grades prevent the school from describing his or her gender, race or whether the student had been in trouble in the past. The school also is working with state and federal officials about potential criminal violations. Officials say the noose was found about 2am Wednesday in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. On Thursday, he praised the reaction of fellow students and administrators at the school. 'I appreciate that immediate action was taken both by the student community to identify a person and by the faculty to ensure that disciplinary action is taken,' he said. Unknown: The university is not identifying the student in question, citing federal education laws protecting student privacy. Above, a view of the Durham, North Carolina campus . Duke Student Affairs Vice President Larry Moneta said the student would face judgment under the school's code of conduct, which includes penalties ranging from probation to expulsion. He said it was 'too soon to make any comment' about whether the student had expressed remorse for the noose episode. 'This is all part of what the investigation will yield and the opportunity for the student to speak to the basis for the behavior,' Moneta said. At a gathering Wednesday in front of the university's Gothic chapel building, Duke President Richard Brodhead told a crowd of several thousand that their presence was a rejection of what the noose symbolizes in a region where lynchings were once used to terrorize black residents. And he said that while administrators and campus police investigate who displayed the noose and why, it is up to each individual to reject racism. 'One person put up that noose, but this is the multitude of people who got together to say that's not the Duke we want,' he told the crowd. 'That's not the Duke we're here for, and that's not the Duke we're here to create.'","The university said Thursday that they have identified an undergraduate student responsible for hanging a noose from a campus tree .

2508,"Patrick Bamford enhanced Middlesbrough’s automatic promotion bid by equalling the club’s record goal return of the modern era. Bamford, the on-loan Chelsea forward, struck his 15th of the campaign, to match the tally of Colombian Hamilton Ricard during the 1998-99 Premier League season. No one has scored more in the 16 intervening years. His deflected 20th-minute effort was enough to earn victory over relegation-threatened Wigan, who now have just six matches to avert the prospect of playing League One football just two years after shocking Manchester City in the FA Cup final at Wembley. Middlesbrough striker Patrick Bamford, on loan from Chelsea, scores the opening goal via a deflection . Bamford celebrates his 17th goal of the season, the fourth that he has scored in his last four games . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Woodgate, Gibson, Friend, Clayton, Leadbitter, Reach, Bamford, Adomah, Vossen. Subs: Tiendalli, Amorebieta, Garcia, Tomlin, Ripley, Whitehead, Forshaw. Wigan: Al Habsi, Boyce, Maguire, Pearce, Bong, Pennant, Perch, Kim, McClean, Clarke, Murphy. Subs: Carson, McCann, Ojo, Barnett, Fortune, Waghorn, Kvist Jorgensen. Referee: Stuart Attwell . Despite being five points adrift of safety, the Lancashire club arrived with an impressive away record, having taken 21 of their 35 points away from the DW Stadium and winning their last four games on the road. However, no second-tier side have taken more points on their own turf than Middlesbrough and Bamford made it nine victories in 10 attempts at the Riverside. It was from a classic counter-attack that Aitor Karanka’s team took the lead. A Wigan free-kick invoked panic in the home penalty area as Dimi Konstantopoulos dropped a high ball at the feet of Leon Clarke, whose instinctive prod goalwards then fortuitously struck the Middlesbrough goalkeeper. But Boro seized on the loose ball and within seconds they had scored. Adam Clayton’s pass utilised Albert Adomah’s pace and Boro were lucky when Jelle Vossen’s heavy touch from a right-wing cross set up Bamford. He curled his shot goalward from 20 yards and a slight deflection off Wigan defender Jason Pearce took it beyond the grasp of his goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi. Jonathan Woodgate plays the ball out of defence as Middlesbrough looked in control for long periods . Albert Adomah gets dow the outside of Josh Murphy  as Middlesbrough continued their promotion push . Despite Bamford stealing the limelight, however, Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka praised the effort of his team. ‘It was a very important win and performance, especially second half. The most important thing is to win the games, to rest well and to think about Monday’s game,’ said Karanka. ‘Everything is going to be tighter. Everyone is playing for something. Wigan were playing to stay up and I think in all games someone has something to play for, so every game will be difficult. ‘Everyone was tired after Bournemouth and there were a lot of games in February and March. Now after the break our heads are fresh and we have four games in the next two weeks. ‘We have experienced players and a lot of games coming up now, Monday and Saturday. There are six games to go and we need all of the players. ‘Patrick scored the goal but there were other players who contributed all around the field.’ Bamford is mobbed by his team-mates after the goal that sent Boro back to the top of the league . Malky Mackay's side remain adrift in the relegation zone after a third defeat in their last five games . Wigan pressed hard for an equaliser after the break and it took a strong right hand from Konstantopoulos to keep out substitute Marc-Antoine Fortune’s effort just after the hour. ‘I’m really disappointed that we didn’t get something out of the game,’ said Wigan manager Malky Mackay. ‘We deserved something. ‘Especially in the second half we went toe to toe with Middlesbrough, one of the best teams in the division, and I am disappointed for my players for the courage they showed.’ Adam Clayton brings down James Perch, but Wigan never really threatened to take the points off their hosts . Things got particularly nervy in injury time when Wigan — with four up front — were camped deep in home territory. Boro had their own chances to seal a more comfortable win but Adomah volleyed wide at the climax of a stunning team move and substitute Lee Tomlin, who coame on for Vossen in the 67th minute, failed to get sufficient contact on a close-range effort seconds after entering the action. Tomlin wasted another opportunity deep into injury time when he slalomed his way down the field on a breakaway but his shot came off the heel of covering defender Harry Maguire. But all Boro cared about was the three points.",Patrick Bamford puts Middlesbrough ahead after 20 minutes . Bamford's deflected shot takes Boro  ahead of Bournemouth .

No one is sure, but the headstone of Hillary Clinton's father, Hugh Rodham, was found tipped over this week, just a couple of days after she announced her run for the White House.

""I pass here five, six times a day because I live two blocks from here and when I looked I couldn't  believe it, to see that it was tipped over."" McGloin said he's tended to the grave site at the Washburn Street Cemetery in Scranton, Pennsylvania, since Rodham was buried there in 1993. Police are investigating, but no other headstones were knocked over. Police Chief Carl Graziano told The Scranton Times-Tribune that he suspects vandalism. ""I'm not sure how else it would have fallen over,"" he said. Still, police will look into the possibility that it was weather-related. Funeral director Neil Regan also said vandalism is the most-likely cause, not the weather. ""The more I thought about it, there were no serious winds or weather events,"" he said.  ""Paul McGloin told me he had driven by here 8 o'clock (Monday) morning and the stone was in place."" McGloin believes it's no coincidence that it happened within days of Clinton announcing her second presidential bid. ""And all of a sudden the headstone is tipped over, two days later,"" he said.

9987,"All Facebook users have them - those friends who are so in love with their newborn baby they clog up your news feed with constant doting updates. But one group of women were so fed up with their friend's 'running commentary' they went to the extreme measure of putting an anonymous letter in her mailbox demanding she give everyone 'a break'. Jade Ruthven, 33, of Perth, Western Australia, was shocked when she found the scathing note claiming to be from ‘a few of the girls’, cruelly criticising her for posting photos of her six-month-old daughter Addison on Facebook. ‘Dear Jade, I have got together with a few of the girls and we are all SO OVER your running commentary on your life and every single thing Addy does,’ the letter begins. ‘We all have kids that we are besotted with ... But we don’t ram it down everyone else’s neck!!!’ Jade Ruthven, 33, of Perth, Western Australia, was shocked when she found a scathing note  criticising her for posting too many photos of her six-month-old daughter Addison on Facebook . Jade Ruthven was devastated when she received the  unsigned letter in her mailbox . As the letter continues, the typos and punctuation become more intense and frequent. ‘She crawls off the mat – we DON”T care!!!!! She’s six months old – BIG DEAL!!!! ‘Stop and think – if every mother posted all that cr*p about their kid – I’m sure you’d get over it pretty quickly.’ The author claims the rant was written on behalf of everyone who views Jade’s Facebook posts. ‘I guess you are just p***ing a lot of people off with all your “Addy this and Addy that”. ‘We all thought it might ease off after the first month but it hasn’t,’ the letter continues. ‘Not everyone is as interested as you are about what Addy does so give us all a break. ‘We’re doing this to let you know what people really think.’ The dental hygienist still doesn’t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty . Jade and her husband Ryan (pictured with their daughter Addison) were both very angry but chose to try and see the funny side of the ridiculous letter . Jade sent the letter to comedian Em Rusciano, who posted it to her Facebook page and described it as 'next-level mean' in an opinion piece for news.com.au. For Jade the letter came completely out of the blue and was like a slap in the face, particularly as she is a first-time mother trying to find her feet. ‘I was actually excited when I checked the mail and saw a hand written envelope thinking it was an invite. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect what was in it!’ Jade told Daily Mail Australia. ‘At first I was in shock and thought this letter must be a joke. I read it and re-read it about four times. ‘I was shaking with anger and shock to think a so-called friend of mine could be so heartless and gutless to not even sign their name.’ The dental hygienist still doesn’t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty. ‘To be honest I have no idea why anyone would do this to me. I don’t think I have had an enemy in my whole life,’ she said. ‘My husband Ryan was just as angry as me but we soon decided to laugh it off as a bad joke. Jade and her friends responded by creating the hashtag #Addyspam and cheekily posting a stream of photos of the beautiful bub on Facebook - sending a strong message to the hateful author . Jade was accused of 'p***ing' everybody off by posting too many photos of her baby daughter on Facebook . ‘These people clearly have too much time on their hands to sit and chat about my Facebook usage. It’s quite sad really.’ The cruel nature of the letter spurred Jade to stand up for herself. She refused to bow down to the bullies. ‘To have someone do this to me, in truth, makes me feel sick,’ said Jade. ‘Lucky for me I am a strong, healthy person. Being a first time mum is hard enough to get your head around but for someone who was feeling alone or who was struggling with the challenges of motherhood this could have had terrible consequences. ‘But it takes a lot more to keep me down than a nasty letter!’ Jade wants the coward author to know their nasty act has not brought her down. She has also vowed to continue to post photos of her treasured baby. ‘I have had people contact me saying if this had happened to them at this time in their bub’s life, it would have sent them over the edge. ‘I am glad I was the one that got this letter, not someone in a more vulnerable state.’ Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘backfired’, as she is ‘feeling more loved and supported than ever’ Jade insists that not for one minute did she consider changing her behaviour on Facebook. Instead, she decided to deal with the bullies with a sense of humour. ‘No way did I feel self-conscious or consider changing my online activity,’ she said. 'That’s how I think this person can’t be that close to me. If they were they would know I would never take this lying down, start crying in the corner and then take myself off Facebook. ’In fact my friends and I started a hashtag, #Addyspam and posted pics of Addy on Facebook all night long!’ Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘backfired’, as she is ‘feeling more loved and supported than ever’. Rather, it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers . ‘The support I have received from family, friends and even total strangers has blown me away.’ Facebook is a crucial tool for Jade and Ryan to share their daughter’s life with their distant relatives. ‘Addy’s grandparents and a lot of family and friends live overseas. Facebook is the only way they can really keep in touch.’ As a mother, Jade knew she didn’t want to stoop to the bullies’ level. Rather, it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers. ‘I want my daughter to grow up a strong and confident girl and if she ever does encounter bullies. ‘I want her to feel strong enough to stand up for herself. ‘Also I think parents should do what feels right for you and your bub. ‘Everyone will try and give you their opinions, just smile and nod!’",A new mother was shocked to receive a scathing letter .

Dorsey, did not respond to her yelling and sat with his hands clasped and stared silently ahead. 'How many birthdays did you miss?' Blair said. 'Never. Never. You understand what I'm saying.' She was removed from the court when she failed to stop shouting, although she returned silently 13 minutes later, reports the Detroit Free Press. State officials are seeking to terminate Blair's parental rights to her other two children, as well as the parental rights of her children's fathers. Blair's two surviving children have been placed into a relative's care. Steven Berry, the father of deceased Stephen and Blair's eight-year-old son, only turned up at towards the end. Both fathers owe thousands of dollars in child support, according to a court document. Wayne County Circuit Judge Edward Joseph required supervised visitation for the fathers, denying a request from attorneys for unsupervised visits with their children because previously each of them had only had visit with their child. Judge Edward J. Joseph presides over a parental rights termination hearing for Mitchell Blair in court . Detroit Free Press reported that after the hearing, Berry declined to comment. Dorsey said Blair had always wanted to see his children and tried to develop a relationship, but Blair would not let him. 'I don't hate her,' he said. 'She's the mother of my children.' Blair initially was charged with child abuse, but more charges had been expected after autopsies revealed the siblings were beaten to death. Investigators believe Stephen died in August 2012 and Stoni died the following May. In a court filing, the state said her daughter described a home where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood and hit and burned with a hot curling iron. Medical exams revealed evidence of abuse, including numerous scars, on the surviving children. Twenty-five scars were found on the boy's back that were consistent with being hit by an extension cord, according to a petition obtained by the Detroit News. Blair's teenage daughter also described how her siblings were killed, according to court papers. 'Blair tortured Stephen for approximately two weeks prior to his death by tying a belt around his neck, throwing hot water on him while in the shower and putting a plastic bag over his head,' the state said, quoting the 17-year-old. Stephen was 'unresponsive' on Aug 30, 2012, and Blair wrapped his body in bed linen and put him in the freezer, the state said. Nine months later, Blair became 'enraged' when Stoni said she didn't like her surviving siblings and strangled the girl with a T-shirt and suffocated her with a plastic bag, the department said. Blair then made the teen 'put Stoni in the deep freezer following her death,' the agency said.

While being questioned, Blair told investigators she placed Stephen 'in a boiling hot tub of water until his feet blistered' because she found out Stephen was allegedly sexually assaulting a relative, according to the Detroit News. Blair also told police that when he died, she wrapped him 'in his favorite blanket' and put him in the freezer, the police report states.

10285,"Jet-setter: Elvis Presley bought both planes in 1975 . They've been one of the biggest highlights of Graceland for 30 years. But Elvis Presley’s planes are to be taken from the grounds of his former mansion after local officials signed off the controversial deal. Memphis City Council agreed yesterday that Hound Dog II and Lisa Marie – named after the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll’s daughter – can be moved from his estate to a site nearby. It means tourists to Graceland will have to pay extra if they want to see the two jets, which are to form a new, separate museum about the dead singer. Graceland visitors can currently buy a ticket that includes a tour of Presley's home-turned-museum and the interiors of the two planes. They have been at the estate since the mid-1980s after Graceland’s managing company, Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE), agreed that the planes’ owner, OKC Partnership, could have a cut of Graceland ticket sales. OKC spokesman Tim McCaskill told Memphis City Council this week that the goal was for construction work at the planes’ new home to be finished in time for them to be moved there for Elvis Week in August. The site is on the same street as Graceland. Big hit: The Lisa Marie, pictured in the grounds of Graceland, was given a major overhaul by Elvis . Hound Dog II: The smaller jet was used by the star during Lisa Marie's refit and was also his back-up plane . OKC has been in a lengthy dispute with EPE, which was bought by New York-based Authentic Brands Group in 2013. Last April, EPE sent a letter to OKC, saying it was exercising its option to end their agreement and asking OKC ‘to make arrangements for the removal of the airplanes and the restoration of the site on or shortly after April 26, 2015’. At one stage, Elvis’s former wife Priscilla stepped into the heated row - telling fans who were outraged at the prospect of the planes being moved to ‘calm down’. Elvis's bedroom: The Lisa Marie had a custom-made, queen-sized bed for the star, who liked to fly at night . Perfectly preserved: A table and chairs in the plane. The seats are now covered in plastic to protect them . Lounge in the sky: There are four TVs in total plus a videotape system in the Lisa Marie . Hot on design: Presley, who oversaw the plane's refurbishment, insisted on gold bathroom taps . Then last September, OKC put them up for sale, saying if they couldn’t stay at Elvis’s former home, they would have to be sold. OKC owner KG Coker, 77, said at the time: ‘I would love to see the airplanes stay where they are forever. ‘Millions of fans have toured those airplanes and there's a real connection between fans and those airplanes. They are part of the Elvis experience.’ The jets were expected to fetch $15million in an auction in January. But they were withdrawn from sale, and OKC made arrangements to have them displayed on land adjacent to Graceland. Hound Dog II was bought by Elvis for $900,000 in September 1975 – less than two years before his death. In November 1975 he paid $250,000 for the larger but secondhand plane Lisa Marie, and spent at least $300,000 having it renovated. He would use Hound Dog II - a Lockheed Jetstar - to fly to Lisa Marie’s hangar to see how the refit was going. When it was finished, Hound Dog II became his back-up jet. Both planes were sold after the singer’s death in August 1977 and bought a few years later by OKC. The Lisa Marie was installed at Graceland in 1984 and the Hound Dog II soon afterwards. Small but comfortable: The eye-catching lime-green and yellow seats in Elvis's Hound Dog II jet . Current home: The jets have been at Graceland since the 1980s, where they have their own entrance (right) Heated debate: Elvis's ex-wife Priscilla Presley joined in the row over whether the planes should stay at Graceland with this tweet to his fans last year. She turned the home into a tourist destination after he died . The Lisa Marie was bought by Elvis from Delta Air Lines in November 1975 for $250,000. It was originally built in 1960, and the singer spent at least $300,000 having the interior overhauled to suit his tastes. He gave it a penthouse-style bedroom with a queen-size bed and in-flight library, an executive conference room finished in teak - and a bathroom with gold sink and taps. The plane also had a bar, four TVs with a videotape system and a state-of-the-art stereo system with 52 speakers. Elvis had the plane painted red, white and blue with his motto TCB - for 'Takin' Care of Business' - on the tail. It was decked out by a team that had previously designed the US president’s plane, Air Force One. During the refurbishment, the Lisa Marie was in a hangar in Fort Worth. Elvis took great pleasure in flying friends there in his smaller Hound Dog II jet to check on the progress of the refit, which he personally oversaw. The Lisa Marie - a four-engine 28-passenger Convair - could fly Presley up to 3,000 miles (4,800km). On each flight there would typically be three crew members. It could hold a maximum of 29 people but usually there would be around eight. The custom-made bed was particularly important to Elvis as he preferred to travel by night. The last journey the plane made for the family was in August 1977 when it transported Elvis's ex-wife Priscilla and his good friend George Hamilton from California to his funeral at Graceland.

444,"(CNN)On April 20, 2010, a final cement seal of an oil well in the Gulf of Mexico failed, causing what has been called the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history and taking the lives of 11 rig workers. For 87 straight days, oil and methane gas spewed from an uncapped wellhead, 1 mile below the surface of the ocean. The federal government estimated 4.2 million barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf, but BP argued in court that it was much lower. A judge ruled BP was responsible for the release of 3.1 million barrels. Imagining Daddy: A rig worker's daughter and her dreams . There were dire predictions of what would follow. Environmentalists and others braced for an environmental collapse on a massive scale. Scientists continue to study environmental impacts, but five years after the spill, the long-term negative effects remain unclear and are, in many cases, highly disputed. BP, the company that caused the spill, is eager to point out it appears the Gulf of Mexico is healing itself. BP's vice president of communications, Geoff Morrell, said there is no doubt birds, fish, turtles, sub-sea vegetation and even sediment species were all affected in the immediate aftermath of the spill. Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. ""There's no question about that,"" Morrell said. ""But they have also, according to the data, bounced back and are recovering strongly."" ""And there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species."" While BP's assessment has not been disproven, the government suggests it's too soon to make long-term conclusions about the rebounding health of the Gulf. Shortly after BP released its own five-year report that concluded the Gulf has largely recovered, the trustees of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment called BP's report ""inappropriate as well as premature."" The trustees, a collection of government agencies tasked with determining the extent of the damage from the Macondo spill, released a statement, saying, ""We know that the environmental effects of this spill are likely to last for generations."" One government official familiar with the trustee's assessment accused BP of having ""cherry-picked"" positive results while ignoring others, something BP denies. Most long-term scientific studies on environmental disasters take longer than the five years that have passed. Studies so far have shown a variety of negative impacts on wildlife immediately after the spill, but others show some of those species are bouncing back. Fish landings in the Gulf, the amount of fish caught by the fishing industry, have returned. Oysters are also recovering in many areas. And according to the Food and Drug Administration, tests on edible seafood show no excess hydrocarbons in the region's food supply. The spill's effects on other species are less clear. Dolphins are dying at an accelerated rate along the Gulf Coast, and even more so in Louisiana where the oil hit the hardest. But the dolphin ""mortality event,"" as the government calls it, began months before the spill. Studies suggest the diseases dolphins suffer from in places like Barataria Bay, Louisiana, could be caused by oil exposure, but direct links to the 2010 Macondo spill have not been proven. Seaside sparrows in the Gulf are also showing signs of strain, and some studies cite oil as contributing to reductions in their overall abundance. While aerial surveys taken in 2010 suggest tens of thousands of sea turtles were exposed to oil in coastal waters, government agencies are still gathering data and have not concluded if the spill will have long-term effects on sea turtle populations. But perhaps the greatest unknown is what, if anything, millions of gallons of oil on the deep seafloor are doing to the overall environment of the Gulf itself. Oceanographers have been tracking the residue from the Macondo well as it has settled on the bottom of the ocean. Mandy Joye, an oceanographer with the University of Georgia, has used underwater robots to capture soil samples and run tests to determine just how far the oil has traveled. Her research and other studies show BP's oil is scattered in patches across more than 1,200 square miles of the seafloor. According to Joye's study the oil residue exists in thin layers in some areas of the seafloor and thick pockets in others. Joye is trying to determine how the oil deposited on the seafloor -- estimated to be about 10 million gallons -- affects the microbial community of organisms that exists in the deepwater ocean. ""That stuff's not going to stay put. It's going to move around, "" Joye said. She said that right now, there is just no way to tell if it will have an impact. ""There's so much that we don't know,"" Joye said. BP doesn't accept the results of Joye's work. The company said its oil is all accounted for and only exists in two places: within a 2 kilometer area around the wellhead and in tar mats and tar balls that have yet to be cleaned up on the beach. And according to BP's Morrell, the oil and residue that remains is no longer harmful. ""So much time has passed that it no longer has any toxicity and is therefore not a threat to humans or aquatic life,"" Morrell said. Ocean conservationist Philippe Cousteau witnessed much of the spill's aftermath in 2010, but when he returned to the Gulf to dive near an oil rig last month, he was astonished by the abundance of amberjacks, hammerhead sharks and other marine life he saw. During the same trip, however, Cousteau spotted a mother dolphin trying to revive a dead calf. It is unknown if its death had anything to do with the oil. Cousteau commended the progress community groups and restoration projects have made since the spill, but he said he believes it's far too early to say the Gulf is back and the oil is gone. ""It is still in many cases in the sand, along the shoreline, in the marshes,"" Cousteau said, ""and existing on a microscopic scale that we may not be able to see with the naked eye."" CNN's David Matthews contributed to this report.","April 20 marks 5 years since the BP oil spill . At the time, there were dire predictions for the environment .

7724,"Robin Williams spent his last days in a paranoid frenzy, aware that 'something else was wrong with him', a British television show will claim tonight. In a 'peculiar' incident just one day before his death, the Oscar-winning actor, who had been diagnosed with Parkinson's, stuffed his collection of watches  into a sock and took it to a friend for safekeeping. The 63-year-old, who had also been prone to episodes of insomnia and anxiety prior to his death, also spent his final 24 hours frantically looking up drugs online, convinced he had another illness. Scroll down for video . Suicide: Robin Williams with wife Susan Schneider in 2009, and the actor months before his death in 2014 . Feud: Mrs Schneider Williams, Williams' third wife, is in a battle with his three children from previous marriages – Zak, Zelda and Cody – over his £33million estate. Above, Mrs Schneider Williams with Williams and Zelda . The post-mortem examination later revealed that Williams had been suffering from Lewy body dementia - an undiagnosed illness would could have been the root cause of his bizarre behaviour. In tonight's episode of Autopsy, which will reconstruct the final hours of the actor's life, pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd explains how Williams' dementia probably triggered his paranoid tendencies. He says that Williams's insomnia and anxiety, as well as periods of confusion and impaired decision making, could also have been connected to the condition. But Dr Shepherd also tells the Channel 5 show - which has previously examined the unexpected deaths of Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley - that the actor may well have been aware of his undetected illness, something which could have exacerbated his paranoia in his final hours. He says that Williams's online activity suggested he knew 'there was something else wrong with him… something that he couldn't put his finger on'. Williams hanged himself in August 2014, a death which sent shockwaves through the celebrity world and led to an outpouring of grief from his worldwide fans. Tribute: Flowers and candles at the Oscar-winning actor's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The day before he hanged himself, Williams stuffed his watch collection into a sock and took it to a friend for safekeeping . Claims: Dr Richard Shepherd, a pathologist, pictured, told Britain's Channel 5 show Autopsy that Williams' online activity in the hours before his death suggested he knew 'there was something else wrong with him' His death was later ruled to have been suicide. The show reveals tonight how, on the day he died, Williams cleaned his bathroom of blood after cutting his wrists. According to the post-mortem report, Williams spent his last night at his Californian home with wife Susan Schneider. LBD is a common form of dementia - it affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the United States. The disease is caused by abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time . This leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning and independent function . The disease takes its name from Frederick H. Lewy - the neurologist who discovered the brain abnormalities  during the early 1900s . It shares symptoms with Parkinson's Disease - sufferers can experience motor control problems, such as hunched posture, rigid muscles and a shuffling walk . Those affected can suffer visual hallucinations, which generally take the form of phantom objects, people or animals  there . It is also linked to Alzheimer's disease as it is more common over the age of 65 and those affected often suffer from confusion and memory loss . Ms Schneider later described how her husband stuffed a number of his jewelled watches into a sock before driving to the house of a friend. Speaking about the incident on tonight's show, Dr Shepherd says: 'This is a very peculiar incident that his wife describes as typical of the increasing paranoia that he had been suffering.' Psychologist Anjula Mutanda also says the actor could have felt 'under threat'. 'Somebody experiencing paranoid feelings may fear that they are in danger and under threat,' she says. Whether it is physiological, physical or financial – harm could be coming their way.' After Williams's body was found, a bottle of quetiapine, a powerful drug used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, was also found unopened in his bedroom. He had been prescribed it a week before his suicide, suggesting his symptoms may have changed prior to his death. In the months before his death, Williams had also checked into rehab to 'fine-tune and focus' on his commitment to staying clean. But the documentary concludes there were no signs that drink or drugs were exacerbating his depression when he died. Blood samples taken after his death showed he had not taken cocaine or alcohol in the last 24 hours of his life. There was also no sign of damage to his liver from previous drinking binges. The show also describes how toxicology reports showed Williams' moods were being controlled by mirtazapine, which is used to treat depressive disorders. Comedy: Williams did stand-up while acting in such films as Good Morning Vietnam and Mrs Doubtfire, pictured . Critical acclaim: The actor found fame with his portrayal of a kooky alien in the 1970s sitcom Mork and Mindy, left with Pam Dawber. He was awarded an Oscar for best supporting actor in Good Will Hunting in 1998, right . Good Morning Vietnam: Williams' played a DJ on Armed Forces Radio during the Vietnam War (pictured) There was also levodopa in his system, which is used to treat Parkinson's. The forthcoming documentary, part of the third series of the show, has already drawn criticism from Williams's fans after it emerged that it featured a 'graphic' reconstruction of the actor's suicide. A Channel 5 spokesman previously said the depiction was kept to 'an absolute minimum' but that its inclusion 'is important in telling the truth'. They added: 'The film celebrates Robin’s career and talent, and within that the tragic details of his death are part of that story.' French actor Alain Poudensan plays Williams in the reconstructed scenes. While Alain has worked as a Robin Williams impersonator for a number of years, he has also starred in many adult films, under the name Alain L'Yle. Williams found fame with his portrayal of a kooky alien in the 1970s sitcom Mork and Mindy. But it was his role as an irreverent DJ with the US Armed Services Radio station in Good Morning, Vietnam in 1987 which won him huge acclaim. His roles ranged from serious and dramatic in films such as Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting, to comedy in Mrs Doubtfire. He was nominated for an Oscar three times before winning an Academy Award for his performance as a psychologist in Good Will Hunting in 1997. Mrs Schneider Williams, his third wife, is currently in a battle with his three children from previous marriages – Zak, Zelda and Cody – over his £33million estate. Zelda recently spoke out about her father's death. When asked why she believed her father took his own life, she said: 'I don't think there's a point. It's not important to ask.' In a statement released shortly after her husband's death, Susan Schneider said that Williams was struggling with depression, anxiety and the Parkinson's diagnosis when he died. Toxicology reports showed there was levodopa in his system, which is used to treat Parkinson's. The disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. It develops gradually, sometimes starting with a small tremor in one hand. The disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. Actor Michael J. Fox, a long-time friend of Williams, is well-known for his efforts to fund research into finding a cure. He was just 29 years old when he was diagnosed with the disease. Robin Williams with actor Michael J Fox, who was just 29 years old when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's . Stage one sees a patient experience mild symptoms that inconvenience day-to-day tasks, including the presence of tremors or experiencing shaking in one of the limbs. Friends and family can generally detect changes in the patient including poor posture, loss of balance, and abnormal facial expressions. In stage two, the patient's symptoms start to affect both limbs and both sides of the body. They usually encounter problems walking or maintaining balance, and the inability to complete normal physical tasks becomes more apparent. During stage three, the disease becomes more severe, with some patients losing the ability to walk straight or to stand and a noticeable slowing of physical movements. Stage four is accompanied by severe symptoms of Parkinson's. Walking may still occur, but it is often limited and rigidity and bradykinesia are often visible. During this stage, most patients are unable to complete day-to-day tasks, and usually cannot live on their own. The tremors or shakiness that take over during the earlier stages however, may lessen or become non-existent for unknown reasons during this time. In stage five, the final stage, Parkinson's disease usually takes over the patients physical movements leaving them unable to take care of themselves and generally unable to stand or walk. A patient at stage five usually requires constant one-on-one nursing care.","Post-mortem examination showed the actor had undiagnosed dementia .

1382,"A holidaymaker was left stranded in Tenerife after thieves stole her passport ID during a family holiday - and Ryanair staff refused to let her fly home over fears she was an illegal immigrant. Loushanna and Shawn Craig from Erdington, Birmingham, had gone away to the island for a three-day break, marking her birthday and the couple's anniversary. But, despite having flown to Tenerife from East Midlands airport, Mrs Craig was marooned on the island for up to two weeks after her biometric ID card was stolen. Loushanna Craig, from Erdington in Birmingham, had gone to Tenerife with her husband for three-day holiday but was refused to fly home over fears she was an illegal immigrant . The couple were on a trip to the volcanoes when Mr Craig had his wallet stolen, which had her biometric ID, as well as their bank cards inside. The 37-year-old was meant to return to the UK on March 9, but she only arrived back on March 24 - having spent more than three times what she had planned. The mother-of-four, who has a Jamaican passport, has now placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of Ryanair. She claims that she has the right documentation to prove she was allowed to return to the UK, but that the budget airline refused to fly her home anyway. She said: 'The whole experience has been humiliating. I will never use Ryanair again.' Mrs Craig, who moved to Birmingham from the West Indies 14 years ago, does not have a full UK passport because she has not yet been given permission to live here permanently. Mrs Craig, with her husband Shawn, who had her biometric ID card stolen while on holiday . Instead, she has the 'right to remain' status, a Government stamp which shows she resides in the UK. That stamp recently ran out, she said. But she has a biometric ID card, given to her by the UK Border Force, which, when used in conjunction with her passport, proves she has the right to reside in this country. She has previously used it as a passport in EU countries. Prior to the holiday, Mrs Craig had also obtained a visa from the Spanish Embassy in London, allowing her to travel out of the country. After the card was stolen, Mrs Craig travelled to Madrid where she was given documentation to prove that her card had been stolen. But when she tried to return home, she was stopped at the Tenerife South boarding desk and the police were called. She was led away, under suspicion of being an illegal immigrant. 'They just didn't want to know,' she said. 'They weren't interested in seeing the papers. I was led away like a crook. I also had a driving licence and bank cards which proved I was from the UK.' Mrs Craig, who was carrying other cards like her driving licence and National Insurance card, then got paperwork from the British Consulate in Tenerife, which also verified that her card had been stolen. But when Mrs Craig attempted to get home, she was turned back again. She alleges that a Ryanair representative at Tenerife South Airport told her: 'We send you Africans to Britain and they just send you back and fine us 6,000 euros.' She said: 'I was left feeling like a criminal.' Mrs Craig was told her Jamaican passport would have to be surrendered and re-stamped before she could return, a process that would have taken at least three weeks. But Desmond Jaddoo, a community activist, then intervened, speeding up the process, meaning she returned home earlier than expected. He described the saga as 'totally unsatisfactory in its entirety'. He said: 'Ryanair failed to take into account her circumstances, they failed to show any form of compassion and the fact that they stereotyped her is of great concern.'

Jihad-watchers noticed thousands of accounts vanishing from the social network last week, most of them claiming to be linked to the extremists currently terrorising vast swathes of the Middle East. Now, after questions were asked about what led to  the largest ever one-off cull of ISIS-affiliated accounts, Twitter has confirmed that its purge was prompted because they were being used by tech-savvy jihadis to issue threats of violence. Online savvy: Jihad-watchers noticed thousands of accounts vanishing from the social network last week, most of them claiming to be linked to the extremists currently terrorising vast swathes of the Middle East . Twitter does not publish data related to the accounts it suspends, but NDTV Gadgets reported that the social network's so-called 'violations department' suspended approximately 10,000 accounts used by ISIS militants or supporters of the terror group on April 2. Speaking on condition of anonymity amid fears for his safety, the representative said the cull was prompted in part by the 'large number of reports' received by online activists and members of the public. Without doubt this is a reference to the 'Operation Anti-ISIS' campaign launched by the online 'hacktavist' collective Anonymous, who encouraged members to find and expose thousands of accounts connected with ISIS and report them to Twitter authorities en masse. While the social network says it remains committed to the platform being used as a symbol of free speech, it says it will not tolerate accounts tweeting sickening messages promoting violence. ISIS - the largest and wealthiest terrorist organisation in history - has long used social media to groom and enlist new recruits, spread sickening propaganda, and glorify rape and massacre. Sick: Twitter's so-called 'violations department' suspended approximately 10,000 accounts used by the ISIS militants themselves (pictured) or by supporters of the terror group, on April 2 . Last month it was revealed that web-savvy militants fighting for ISIS could control as many as 90,000 Twitter accounts worldwide, allowing them to spread their sickening propaganda with ease. The terror group is able to 'exert an outsized impact on how the world perceives it' because of its shrewd use of social media and sheer number of online followers, terror experts have concluded. Recommendations in the report by the Washington-based Brookings Institute report include governments and social media companies working together to find new ways to tackle the problem of pro-ISIS accounts spreading horrific murder videos and images and jihadist rhetoric. While Twitter has had success in suspending the accounts, they are effectively playing an exasperating game of whack-a-mole as banned users almost-immediately set up another account. They then encourage ISIS sympathisers who have not yet been banned to share the details of their new profile and within a matter of hours can have thousands of people once again reading their messages of hate.","Thousands of accounts vanished from the social network last week .

11338,"As a wealth management consultant for a prestigious London firm, Craig Lister is used to keeping his cool. But lately, that's become rather more difficult. Craig, 54, is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer, which starves cancer cells by reducing levels of testosterone in the body - and has the side-effect of hot flushes. 'I have about ten to 12 flushes a day, and six to eight at night,' says Craig, a Yorkshireman who lives in Watford, Hertfordshire, with wife Sue, a teacher, 52, and their three children, George, 22, Evie, 20, and Joseph, 18. Craig, 54, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012. He is now well and his tumours have shrunk . 'I know when one's coming. The feeling suddenly builds up as if you've gone into a sauna. Within minutes I'm in full sweat. Five or ten minutes later, it's gone.' Craig has taken to carrying a spare shirt in his briefcase when he goes to meet clients. 'I'll turn up to a lunch and suddenly have a hot sweat and my shirt will be soaked,' he says. 'I nip off to the loos and have a wash and change.' Hormone therapy, usually given in the form of regular injections or implants, is the first treatment offered to men with advanced prostate cancer - where the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. It can't cure the cancer, but can help keep it under control. Hormone therapy is also given alongside radiotherapy to some men with localised prostate cancer to shrink the cancer and make it easier to treat. The jabs typically contain drugs called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) blockers. These act on the pituitary gland in the brain, to stop the production of hormones which are released into the bloodstream and bind with cells in the testicles to make testosterone. Even though the cancer is now microscopic he is still taking hormone treatment . The majority of prostate cancers rely on the hormone to grow. Lowering the amount in the body means it's less able to spread. In England alone, 13,000 men receive the treatment every year - in the form of jabs given monthly or every three months according to the charity Prostate Cancer UK. However, blocking testosterone can cause a variety of side-effects, explains Ali Rooke, a specialist nurse at the charity. 'Testosterone is a man's natural source of energy, so along with hot flushes we often see fatigue. It also has an important role in sexual function, so there can be a loss of libido,' she says. 'There can be mood swings and depression; some men also report breast swelling, nipple tenderness and weight gain around the middle. All of these are similar to what women go through during the menopause, when levels of their equivalent hormone, oestrogen, start to fall.' Hormone therapy also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and can cause bone thinning, because testosterone is important for bone density. Studies by Prostate Cancer UK have found that 80 per cent of men having hormone therapy will suffer hot flushes, and 27 per cent of these say it is the side-effect that troubles them the most. This rings true for Craig. 'People don't tell you much about hormone therapy at the beginning,' he says. 'I am basically a menopausal man. I have mood swings and I've put on two-and-a-half stone. But the worst thing has been the hot sweats. I'm up a few times a night, sometimes having to change the sheets and it's tiring. 'Of course, this wakes Sue up, too, and then she's worrying. 'She used to have hot flushes and so she's very sympathetic. The difference with me is that I don't know if they will ever end.' Men with advanced prostate cancer could be on hormone therapy for the rest of their life, says Ali Rooke. 'But men who are on it along with radiotherapy tend to only have it for up to three years until the cancer has been treated.' She says the charity receives hundreds of calls every year from men struggling with hot flushes and side-effects of hormone therapy. 'Men are warned about side-effects, but clinic appointment times are not long, so doctors can't realistically talk through them all in detail. It's also hard to predict what side-effects a man will have and how he will respond.' There are treatments to alleviate hot flushes, such as drugs based on the female hormone progesterone, which has an effect like testosterone but doesn't fuel the growth of cancer cells. Some men find that complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, or herbal supplements, such as sage tea or black cohosh, help, but the benefits are yet to be proven clinically. But now new research suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, a psychological technique and talking therapy, could help. This causes hot flushes and night sweats . A trial on prostate cancer patients at King's College London, published in March, has shown such impressive results that it is likely to be offered nationally. CBT works by helping people understand the links between their beliefs, thoughts and behaviour. It's a recognised treatment for anxiety and other mental health conditions. Myra Hunter, professor of clinical health psychology at King's, has previously found that CBT reduces hot flushes in menopausal women, and breast cancer patients who are experiencing them as a result of treatments that reduce levels of oestrogen. 'Beliefs about hot flushes can exacerbate the symptoms,' she says. Professor Hunter believes that by replacing overly negative thoughts about hot flushes with more helpful, positive ones, they will have less of an impact. Her latest study recruited 68 men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer, all of whom were experiencing at least ten hot flushes and night sweats a week. Half the group were given treatment as usual (access to doctors and information about the problem) and the other half received a self-help CBT booklet, a CD and two sessions with a psychologist. The men were taught breathing exercises, advised on lifestyle changes and sleep management, and encouraged to challenge negative beliefs and presumptions. 'Women feel hot flushes are a signifier of their age and reproductive status,' says Professor Hunter. 'In our interviews with men, we found the hot flushes signified a threat to their masculinity. 'They felt the hot flushes had social consequences - people would think that there was something wrong with them. And they catastrophised, so if they had one in the night they assumed they'd feel terrible the next day.' After six weeks, the CBT group's hot flushes were 40 per cent less problematic and 36 per cent less frequent, compared with 12 per cent and 16 per cent reductions in the control group. CBT is not always easily available on the NHS. Professor Hunter is hoping to offer her self-help audio guide and booklet for hot flushes free through Prostate Cancer UK, but this has not yet been confirmed. Craig was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer three years ago, at the age of 50, so quality of life is important to him. By the time of his diagnosis, the cancer had spread beyond the prostate to his lungs and to the lymph nodes in his pelvis and abdomen, so surgery was not an option. While the hormone treatment has been helpful, the hot flushes have been hard to deal with. He is about to try a new type of radiotherapy, but expects to be on hormone therapy indefinitely. However, he says taking the right attitude to hot flushes has helped him hugely. 'From the beginning I've been open about my condition, so all my friends and clients know why I have hot flushes. 'It's nothing to be embarrassed about. My family and I have learned to live in the now and be grateful for what we've got.' prostatecanceruk.org .","Craig Lister, 54, from Watford,  is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer .

Surveillance footage of the dramatic incident shows Collins, who was walking ahead of McNamee, turn round when he hears him fall. He walks to the edge of the platform of the Septa (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority) subway's 15th Street station, jumps down and helps McNamee to escape.

To the rescue: After he realized that McNamee had fallen, Collins jumped onto the tracks after him . Collins stepped forward to speak about his actions as footage of the rescue was broadcast on TV screens and online across the nation. But despite the widespread praise for his actions, he put it all down to 'instinct' and denied that he is a hero. McNamee was badly hurt by the fall. He broke his back and several ribs, shattered a kneecap and damaged his spleen - but managed to get away with his life. According to local TV station WPVI, Collins went to visit McNamee in hospital the day after the rescue. Heave: Other commuters can be seen to the left pulling McNamee to safety . Hero's return: Collins was pulled from the dangerous tracks - which have an electrified third rail - just after McNamee . The incident took place around 6:30pm on Wednesday - at which time schedules for the Market-Frankford line say a train arrives around every eight minutes. Speaking to WPVI, Collins said: 'I just saw him and jumped down... just instincts'. He also insisted that he's 'not a hero'. Collins hurt his leg during the rescue, but it was only a minor wound. Septa officials commended Collins's bravery, but said that others shouldn't copy him. The best thing to do instead, a rail service spokesman said, is to alert the station's cashier, who will be able to stop any incoming trains and dispatch a rescuer.","Charles Collins, 28, saved elderly Alfred McNamee after he fell onto tracks .

5014,"Illicit operation: Chiropractor Gertrude Pitkanen would sell newborn babies to adoptive parents for as little as $100 in Butte, Montana . For as little as $100, chiropractor Gertrude Pitkanen took babies from their mother's arms seconds after they were born and handed them to their adoptive parents. As the infants were driven to their new homes, the families were sometimes forced to throw their afterbirth out of the window because they were removed so quickly. These transactions formed the basis of a lucrative, illicit market that started in Butte, Montana, in 1920s, and grew until Pitkanen decided to stop in the 1950s. Most of the children who were victims of this horrific crime have now aged, have families and have forged their own lives - but they are still looking for answers. They have joined together to form a group called Gertie's Babies who have been using DNA to trace their biological families and search for their estranged siblings that are still alive. Only a six of them have come together, but they believe there are many more people who were given up by Pitkanen out there, and simply do not know it. Heather Livergood, 69, was purchased for $100 in a motel room in 1946.  Now 69 she lives in Coeur d'Alene, northern Idaho, with her husband Steve. This May she will have been married for 47 years, has three children and is expecting a grandchild this month. Last year, while using sites such as Ancestory.com and 23andMe.com, she was able to track down two half brothers Bob and Gary, who live in Grantsville, Utah. Her birth mother was called Violet Weyland Sandberg, and discovered the circumstances which forced her to abandon her as a child. While her husband, Evan Sandberg a member of the Army Air Corps, had been fighting in the Pacific, she got pregnant with another man's child, prompting her to take desperate action. She told the Daily Mail Online that her biological aunt, Julia, had told her children before she died that Violet had spent two months with a man in Montana while her husband was fighting. On a night in 1946, Violet traveled 450 miles from Grantsville to give birth in Butte. That decision forged a certain future for Mrs Livergood, . She moved into a good home with her adoptive family. Her mother died when she was three and she was raised by her father, a man who she said was 'great, very funny and outgoing', and a stepmother. Heather Livergood (center), now 69, was given up for adoption in 1946 but has been reunited with brothers Gary (left) and Bob (right) following a trip to Grantsville, Utah, last year . However she has sympathy for her birth mother, because she had gotten herself into trouble. She told the Spokesman-Review in an interview last year: 'I couldn't give up a child, but I don't blame her for that. And you know, things weren't very good when the war got out. People didn't have a lot of money.' Her adoptive father also shared a detail from the night she was born which prompted her to dig further into her family history. Mrs Livergood told the Daily Mail Online she visited her brothers last year after tracking them down and keeps in contact with them on a regular basis. She plans to return for another trip as she continues to build a relationship with them. Some others however have been unsuccessful in their search. Mrs Livergood discovered her birth mother was called Violet Weyland Sandberg. She got pregnant with another man while her husband was away at war . Bonnie Gower told the Daily Mail Online that when she was born, she was given to parents who couldn't have children through traditional methods. They had already adopted two boys and wanted a girl  but they were told they couldn't have anymore. 'A friend of theirs who had a adopted a son through Gertie got a call from the local go between asking them if they wanted a baby girl,' she told the Daily Mail Online. 'They said no but called my mom and asked. My parents said yes and they drove to Butte to get me. My birth certificate is filled out in my Dad's handwriting.' Her adoptive parents were told what to write and they handed over $500 to complete the transaction. She added: 'He [her father] said he couldn't remember if they went the day I was born (probably not), but the date they were to write down was the day they got me. Throughout her childhood, Mrs Gower was always told she had been adopted and lived a good life. Her parents always said she was 'special' because they picked her. 'I did not know the black market baby stuff until I was ready to get married and decided I wanted to try to get my medical history, ' she said. 'In contacting the state they said there was no adoption papers and that I wasn't adopted. Then I got the story from my parents. 'My mom's words were...""we were never going to tell"". But they knew nothing of the birth mother and asked no questions. 'I think they knew what they were doing was illegal, but they just wanted a baby and put that little fact away.' Mrs Gower has since completed the checks on Ancestory.com and has only found connections to third cousins. She has contacted them but is yet to receive a reply. 'I suppose I will continue my search for many more years...but not aggressively as I did when we all connected,' she added. Sue Docken was also sold for $500 in 1951 from on office building in Butte. The transaction was expected to last just a few minutes, so her adoptive's mother's husband was told to leave the car running as he waited outside. She went back to the empty office building about a month ago to see where the exchange unfolded. Mable Deane, 65, who runs the Gertie's Babies website, was given up in 1949, and is yet to learn much about her past. Pitkanen was never held accountable for the black market scheme which tore families apart. She was born in 1878 and trained as a nurse and chiropractor before moving with her husband Gustave Pitkanen to Butte. She died in 1960, but escaped criminal prosecution. It's not known how much money she made from the scheme or how many of the adoptions she organised over at least three decades. According to The New York Times she worked with the political and business elite and had a 'black book' with intelligence she could use as blackmail. She was charged with botched abortions on multiple occasions, but each time a judge threw out the case, fearing the repercussions of what she might do. Pitkanen also made her service available to prostitutes, an industry that was thriving in Butte at the time of her operation. Others who got pregnant out of wedlock or through affairs also used the service.","Gertrude Pitkanen started the illicit scheme in Butte, Montana in the 1920s .

1412,"If selected on Sunday, David Templeton will form part of a Rangers guard of honour to recognise the outstanding Championship success of his former club. There will be no feelings of envy as he applauds Hearts on to the Ibrox pitch. Despite enduring much injury-induced frustration in his three seasons in Govan, the winger remains adamant he can prove his worth by rekindling the kind of form he once showed in maroon. Templeton made his first start in almost three months last weekend as Stuart McCall's recorded a 4-1 victory over Cowdenbeath. That followed up a breakthrough win over Hibernian at Easter Road and enhanced confidence ahead of a real litmus test of their recent progress. Rangers ace David Templeton promotes tickets for Sunday's match against Hearts at Ibrox . Hearts romped to the title with seven games to spare and currently sit 26 points in front of a Rangers side fighting to finish as best of the rest ahead of the play-offs. This wasn't a scenario Templeton could ever have envisaged when he moved west along the M8 in August 2012, away from Vladimir Romanov's teetering reign that would eventually lapse into administration. Back then, Rangers were just starting to emerge from their own, even deeper, financial meltdown of liquidation. Few predicted any on-field problems in their journey back up the leagues. Rangers' Haris Vuckic & Nicky Clark training at Murray Park ahead of the clash with Hearts . This season has told a very different story. Templeton, though, insists he has had no regretful thoughts of what it would be like to somehow still be a Hearts player. 'No, because I think I would have been away the following season anyway,' he said. 'At the time I moved, it was the right time for me, I was kind of forced out, as well. 'It was just one of those things, it was a good move at the time and if we can go up through the play-offs then I still think it would have been a good move. Rangers' Tom Walsh training at Murray Park ahead of their clash with runaway leaders Hearts . 'It's massive that we do that. When I signed for Rangers with the squad we had, I thought we would go up each year. For us as a club - and the supporters and everyone - it's massive to get back to the top league. 'My time here has been pretty frustrating, personally. The first season I really enjoyed, although I picked up a couple of injuries which didn't help. 'Last season, I had a couple of little niggles pre-season and then I didn't play a lot. This season, the exact same. Hopefully now I can keep myself fit and start afresh if we go up.' Rangers captain Lee McCulloch holds the ball up as his teammates look on during a training session . Templeton is not among the dozen or so first-team players out of contract this summer, with 12 months still left on his deal. 'The fans have definitely not seen the best of me,' he admitted. 'I need to get back playing the way I was before I signed here because that was the reason I signed for Rangers. 'I know that I'm good enough to get back to that and hopefully the manager sees that in me.' Rangers trialists Milos Milovic (left) and Josef Shirdel (right) are put through their paces during training . Templeton on Friday lauded the difference McCall has made since his arrival last month. The 26-year-old claimed he now felt more confident about expressing himself on the field. 'Earlier in the season, I played a few games and didn't do too well, but at the same time the team wasn't doing as well either and it's hard to stand out then,' he said. 'Last Saturday we were really attacking and creating a load of chances which made me feel a lot better, a lot more confident. The manager has given me the confidence as well since he has come in. Rangers' Lee Wallace tests his reaction speeds as he is put through his paces during training . 'Even before I'm going on in games, he'll just tell me to stay wide, get the ball and attack. It doesn't matter how many times I lose it in the final third, but just to try and make things happen. As a winger, that's what you like to hear - that you're not going to be criticised for trying to do the right things.' Hearts have won both previous matches against Rangers this term but Templeton believes the gap in those games was not significant. 'The past few times we have played Hearts we didn't actually do too badly,' he added. 'In the first game of the season we should have won it - I missed a sitter at 0-0 and if I had scored it we would have gone on to win the game. Templeton holds the ball up as a Rangers teammate looks to dispossess him during a training session . 'The second game, we started well and they couldn't get out of their half. But then we had a man sent off which didn't help us. 'It will be good to play against them on Sunday. They have been excellent this season and thoroughly deserved to win the title. But we will work on how we will play and I am sure we will all be ready.' McCall is dismissive of any suggestion that Hearts might somehow slacken off having already secured a Premiership return. Hearts' Jordan McGhee (right) speaks with teammate Callum Paterson at training ahead of their game . 'If you have won nine on the bounce and you are champions then you are going to have a lot of confidence,' insisted the Ibrox boss. 'Every one of their players will have that. They also have a real good spirit. 'It is a test for us but every game between now and the end of the season will bring a test. Going down to Queen of the South on Thursday will be tough. 'But I take the point that people will look at the Hearts game and think it might be a barometer of how far we have come. The Hearts squad train at Tynecastle ahead of their fixture with Rangers on Sunday . 'We have improved each game and that is all we are asking for again. But we will slip up between now and the end of the season, no doubt. We won't win every game. 'There will be ups and downs but it is about how we handle it. There is a little bit of belief back in the players again, but we know it is only two wins. No-one is getting carried away.' *All tickets previously purchased for the abandoned Rangers v Hearts game at Ibrox on Friday, 16 January are still valid.

Looking to his dad for reassurance, the young boy asks whether he is safe and his dad comically replies: ‘That’s pretty strong glass, hopefully.’ The dad then states: ‘Wow, that’s cool,’ as the bear, which is believed to be called Cheyenne, sits calmly next to the youngster, as if enjoying his company from the other side of the partition. The father then instructs his son to put his hand up against the glass and as he does so the bear moves towards him with its nose rubbing against the glass. The young boy at first doesn't seem too interested in the bear, then starts posing for the camera as the animal begins to interact and appears to try and bite him through the glass . The bear then begins mouthing at the partition, which causes the youngster’s parents to laugh and the father to say: ‘He wants to chew on you.’ Moving back to his original position, Gabriel puts both of his hands up on to the glass window and suddenly the bear springs into action and jumps up to greet him. Helping the bear out, Gabriel moves his hands to be in line with its paws and looks around at the camera to smile. Meanwhile the bear opens its mouth wide and attempts to bite the youngster through the glass. Later in the video the bear rubs up against the partition and shakes the top half of its body dry before following the boy’s hand with its mouth, as if planning to bite it through the glass. The youngster’s dad then states: ‘That sign said they would eat anything, do you think they would eat a Gabriel?’ The boy and bear go on to play together as the boy puts his hands against the glass and the animal mimics his actions . At one point the boy Gabriel tells his family 'he wants me to get in there' Before humorously answering his own question with: ‘probably.’ Becoming more playful, the bear suddenly comes alive and actually appears to dance while rubbing up against the glass once more. Gabriel says: ‘He wants me to get in there,’ before cautiously walking away from the bear  and stating: ‘He better not break through.’ The young boy then starts moving left to right and despite the distractions of a young girl and the video maker, the bear swims after him. The video concludes with the youngster attempting to coax the bear out of the water, before giving up and standing opposite it once more.",The boy named Gabriel holds his hands up to the bear's paws .

5339,"An infertile woman convinced her new husband to repeatedly rape her 15-year-old daughter so she could have another child. Misty Machinshok, 33, has been jailed for 15 to 30 years for the abuse in which she 'coached' the pair on the best positions to conceive, and held her daughter's hand 'the first few times'. She planned to tell friends and family that the teenager got pregnant with a stranger at a house party in their home town of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Her 29-year-old husband Gary Machinshok, who she met through a website called onlinebootycall.com, will be sentenced this month after pleading no contest to raping the child 'every few days' throughout 2013. Jailed: Misty Machinshok, 33, pleaded no contest to all charges for convincing her new husband to rape her 15-year-old daughter. The court heard it was a plot to have another child, as she is no longer fertile . He also admitted to sexually assaulting her 11-year-old sister but struck a plea deal which means he cannot be charged for it. Prosecutor Nancy Violi called the crime 'the most heinous' she had dealt with in 14 years on the job. The rape came to light when one of the girl's friends alerted a teacher who called police, Violi said. Both victims are now in foster care. Awaiting sentencing: Her husband Gary Machinshok, 29, whom she met on onlinebootycall.com, has admitted raping the girl 'every few days' in 2013, and sexually assaulting her 11-year-old sister . It is not clear why Mrs Machinshok is no longer able to have children. In January, she pleaded guilty to rape, aggravated assault, conspiracy, child endangerment and other counts. Defense attorney Mary Deady conceded that her client had made 'a lot of bad decisions,' but said she was pleading guilty to protect the child from having to testify. Mrs Machinshok' father, Bill Englert, also leaped to her defense to say her involvement in the rape was 'over-emphasized' by prosecutors, according to Inquisitr.","Misty Machinshok of Pennsylvania is no longer able to have children .

5843,"It's a dilemma many of us have faced - whether to call in sick to the office when you wake up feeling under the weather, or brave heading in and spreading your germs. However, for one man - whose company requires a sick note even for a single day off - he handed his bosses more than just the usual doctor's letter. The unnamed worker, from Alberta, Canada, instead came armed with with a scathing note from his GP, giving the firm - believed to be Pizza Hut - a ticking off for its office policy 'wasting his time'. A man said to be an employee of Pizza Hut shared his doctor's sicknote with a friend, who posted it on Reddit . A friend of the employee posted the letter on Reddit under the title, 'my friends work requires a doctors note if you call in sick', and it has now be shared thousands of time online. Clearly annoyed at having their time 'wasted' writing sick notes for common colds, the unnamed Canadian doctor opens the letter praising their patient for 'sensibly staying home from work'. The GP writes that the patient, 'has had, by their own report, a cold today and sensibly stayed home from work rather than spreading this to his colleagues/customers. 'I have no test for the common cold and therefore believe him/her, however you feel his time and mine should be wasted by making him sit in the walk in clinic for hours and me spending time writing a sick note that I could be spending on people who genuinely need my attention. 'Please reconsider your policy on this - there are surely better ways of wasting your tax dollars.' The note posted on the social media site has had 4,340 comments and the poster, who goes by the name eaglel66 only reveals that the employee is a friend of his. Employers sick policies vary around the world but this doctors' note sparked a lively debate on Reddit . Commenters were outraged, with one posting: 'I'm sorry, but any workplace that requires a note for sickness is ridiculous. We're grown a** people.' But some Redditors defended the doctor's note system. One commenter, dyakies wrote: 'I'm a waitress and I have to provide a doctor's note. I get people abuse the system but I'M DEALING WITH FOOD AND THE PUBLIC.' Although one, more cynical, person added: 'Is your friend ""sick"" a lot? I never required any documentation, until I noticed one of my guys has ""allergies"" mostly on Mondays.'

5128,"Tiger Woods ended a week of speculation and debate over the state of his game by announcing on Friday that he will play next week in the Masters. The 39-year-old played an 18-hole practice round on Tuesday at Augusta National, and Golf Channel said he was seen on the practice range Friday morning at the club. 'I'm playing in the Masters,' Woods said on his website. 'It's obviously very important to me, and I want to be there. 'I've worked a lot on my game, and I'm looking forward to competing. I'm excited to get to Augusta, and I appreciate everyone's support.' Scroll down for video . Woods announced on Friday that he will be playing at the Masters in Augusta next week (above Woods at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines on February 5) He said: 'I've worked a lot on my game, and I'm looking forward to competing. I'm excited to get to Augusta' Woods, a four-time Masters champion, last competed at the Farmers Insurance Open on February 5 at Torrey Pines when he walked off the course after 11 holes because of tightness in his lower back, and after another shockingly bad display of chipping. That followed a missed cut at the Phoenix Open, where he shot a career-high 82. He will have gone nine weeks without competition when he hits his opening tee shot on Thursday at the Masters, which is not unprecedented for Woods. He went nearly five months without playing when he returned in 2010 from a crisis in his personal life that led to one of the greatest downfalls in sport, and he tied for fourth that year. Scrutiny might be even greater this time around. After two trips to Augusta National this week, Woods announced his return to the competition (above Woods at the Phoenix open on January 30) Woods hits a shot on the fourth hole during the final round of the 2013 Masters Tournament at Augusta National in April 2013 . The last time Woods took an extended break before the Masters, he had won his previous tournament at the Australian Masters. Now, his game has been in disarray over a series of injuries and another change in coaching. Woods has plunged to No. 104 in the world ranking, his lowest spot since a week before his first professional victory in 1996. He last won a tournament in August 2013 at the Bridgestone Invitational, and he has not had a top ten since the end of 2013. Woods missed the Masters last year because of back surgery to alleviate a pinched nerve. Four tournaments into his return, he again dealt with back pain and sat out the final four months of the season to fully recover and get stronger. Woods celebrated making the winning putt on the 18th green during the 2005 Masters Golf Tournament at Augusta National . But when he returned at his Hero World Challenge in December, he tied for last in an 18-man field and chipped so poorly that some analysts said he had the chipping yips. He would either duff them short or blade them over the green. At the Phoenix Open this year during the pro-am, Woods hit a bunker shot that went over the green and into the first row of bleachers. 'He's got to go out and probably exorcise some of those demons,' Paul Azinger, a former PGA champion and ESPN analyst, said Thursday. 'The first little pitch shot he's got to hit — not chip shot, the first little pitch shot he's got to hit — will be microanalyzed, and he knows that. There's a big microscope on that guy. 'I don't think he'd show up unless he feels like he solved that problem.' Woods will be closely watched during the Masters tournament next week, said former PGA champion Paul Azinger (above Phil Mickelson shakes hands with Woods after he won the Masters in 2005) A week after withdrawing in the middle of his round at Torrey Pines, Woods announced that his game and scores were unacceptable and he would not return until he felt he could compete at the highest level. When he skipped the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, he said he hoped to be ready for the Masters and would continue working. Second-hand reports have ranged from Woods playing well at his home club of The Medalist in South Florida to making five birdies in a round of 74 at Augusta National earlier this week. Next week, he will be playing his first major since turning 39 in December. No player has won more than three major titles beyond his 39th birthday.",Four-time Masters champion made the announcement on Friday .
